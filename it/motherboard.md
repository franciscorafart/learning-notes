## Cables

### Universal Serial us cables (USB)

USB 1, 2, 3, and 4 are distinguished by their speed. Each have corresponding connector types that might look similar.

## USB 2.0
type A: Classic rectangle USB connector (Black in the inside)
type B (square printer type)
type B mini: (Cameras, my old blue harddrive)
Type B micro (Cellphone - old android)

# USB 3.0 and 3.1

USB 3 has confusuing naming conventions
USB 3.0, USB 3.1 (Gen 1), USB 3.2 (Gen 1) => All the same 625Mb/s
USB 3.1 (GEn 2), USB 3.2 (Gen 2) => All the same 1.25GB / s

Type A: Same shape as type A (They have a blue connector inside to distinguish it, or are marked with `SS` for SuperSpeed)
Type B: Square but larger than the classic printer type cable.
Type B micro: large and thin (My LaCie drive)
Type C: USC-C can handle video and laptop charging

Lightning cable => USB too

# USB 4
Only with USB-C connectors, don't confuse it with Thunderbolt 4. USB4 is based on Thurnderbolt 3.
Minimum 20GB/s, Max 40MB/s, handles video.

# Thunderbolt
Standard created by Intel and Apple for transfering data, mostly in Macs. 
Min and Max: 40GB/s, handles video.

Since Thunderbolt 3, it uses a USB-C connector, Previously it had the square thundebolt (old Mac I had)

Thunderbolt connectors have a spark to differentiate them from standard USB-C connectos
Thurnderbolt 4 is USB4 with extra features (Spark with a 4 underneath)

### Video
- Vga

Thurnderbolt

- Lightning and thunderbolt cables are us

### SATA Hard drive cables
- Serial Advancement Technoogy (SATA) => It has two cables, a power and a data cable => Most used today
- Molex Power connector => Outdated (4 pin)
- External SATA
