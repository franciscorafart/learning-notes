# React Router

In normal html sites, when you go to different urls that implies making a GET request and getting the source files from the server for a partiular address.

React Router allows url navigation on a single web React app. It is a Router that uses the navigation API in the browser (pushState, replaceState, popState) to keep the UI in sync with the url.

With it, we can use the URL for internal routing in a React application, and the content of the page will only manipulated with Javascript.

# useNavigate
useNavigate is a method that allows for the URL to be changed programatically.
