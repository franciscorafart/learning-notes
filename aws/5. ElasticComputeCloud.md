# Elastic Compute Cloud

## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- Most popular AWS service
- Infratructure as a Service

Capabilities
- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
- Distribute loads across machines (ELB Elastic Load Balancer)
- Scale services (ASG Auto-scaling group)

EC2 are virtual servers that we rent from aws

Characteristics of machine
- OS: Linux, Windows or MacOS
- Compute power: Cores / CPU units
- RAM
- Storage
    - Network attached EBS / EFS
    - Hardware attached (EC2 instance store)
- Network card: Speed of card, public IP address
- Firewall rules: Security groups
- Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 user data

## EC2 User Data
We can bootstrap our machine instance using EC2 User data scripts, run once on start.

- The script can install updates, software, download files from internet, etc, al when starting the instance.
- EC2 data scripts run with the root user `sudo`

## Virtual machine types
There's different types of Virtual machines with different capacities. For practicing use `t2.micro`, which should be free for a monthrunning continously on the free tier.


# Instances

## Configuration

### Network
When configuring an instance you can allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS access to it.

### Key pair
Create a key pair for SSH (Secure shell) access from anywhere (0.0.0.0)

### Advanced
On the `User Data` or `Info` textfield you can add custom scripts that run the first time (only) the EC2 instance is booted.    s

### Properties
AMI: EC2 instance operating system
Key pair: The key pair to access the EC2 instance via SSH

Id: The unique Id of an EC2 instance
Public Ipv4 address: Public IP address to access the instance from the internet. AWS will change the public IP address of an instance if you stop and restart it.
Private IPv4 address: Private IP address to access the EC2 instance internally from AWS (other services). AWS won't change the internal IP address when stopping and restarting.

Inbound rules: What ports of the instance are accessible from where (0.0.0.0 is everywhere)


### Stopping instances
If you stop an instance AWS will not bill you for it, so for testing purposes is better to have a stopped instance. Restarting the instance keeps the state because there's a volume attached to it (Storage).

## Instance types
There's different types of instances with different combinations of Compute, Memory, network bandwidth `https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/`

### Naming convention
For example: m5.2xLarge

m: instance class
5: generation (hardware generation)
2xLarge: Size within instance class

### Different instance types

- General purpose => Balanced resources, good for web servers, code repositories. Ex: t2.micro is a geenral purpose instance.
- Compute optimized => More compute intensive applications, batch processing, media transcoding, high-performance computing, servers, machine learning, dedicated gaming servers. Ex. C series ones C5, C6
- Memory optimized (RAM)=> Processing of large datasets. High performance relational / non-relational databases, distributed web cache stores, in-memory databases.  R series (Ram), as well as X1 series
- Storage optimized. For high frequency of online transaction processing, relational and non-sql databases, cache (Redis), Data warehouse, Distributed file systems.

## Security groups (Firewall) and classic ports view

- Security groups are the fundamental of security on AWS.
- They control what is allowed as inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instance.
- Security rules reference each other by IP addresses (other computers with access) or security groups

Ec2 instance => Attaches Security group / Firewall => Security group has rules

Security groups regulate 
- Access to ports
- Authorized IP ranges (Ipv4 or Ipv6)
- Controls inbound and outbound network.

- A security group can be attached to multiple instances.
- They are locked into a region an VPC combination
- It's dettached from the EC2 instance, meaning if the security group blocks a request, the EC2 instance won't see it.
- If the application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security group issue. If the error is Connection Refused, then the Security group works fine and it's an EC2 error.
- Default: All inblud traffic blocked, all outbound traffic allowed.

* Advanced important feature
If two ec2 intances have attached the a same security group, they'll be able to communicate directly.

### Important for exam
Ports
22 => SSH (Secure Shell)
21 => FTP (File transfer protocol)
22 => SFTP (Secure File transfer protocol, via SSH)
80 => http (unsecured websites)
443 => https (secured websites)
3389 => RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows instance

* Every time you se a Time Out (hanging) when connecting to an Ec2 instance, 100% of the time is a security group rule issue.

## SSH (Secure Shell into server)
ssh can be user on Mac, Linux and Windows > 10. Windows < 10 use Putty. They do the same thing, allow you to use the ssh protocol
Instance connect => Access the console from the browser.

Ssh allows you to connect to a remote server shell. To do this we need:
- .pem file with key pair
- Public Ip address of EC2 instance

Command to run:
 `ssh -i <my_pem_file> ec2-user@<public_ip_here>`

 Make sure the pem file has proper authorizations: `chmod 0400 <file_name>`

 

 We use ec2-user because the Amazon Linux AMI has a default user called ec2-user
