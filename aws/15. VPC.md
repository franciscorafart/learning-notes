# Virtual Private Cloud


## Ip Addresses in AWS
Two kinds ipv4 & ipv6

### Public ipv4
Whenever we create an EC2 instance we get a new public ipv4 address every time we restart it.

### Private ipv4
Private ip address that can be used on private networds (LAN) to communicate services inside AWS.
- Private Ip address is fixed for EC2 instances (Even when stopped and start)

### Elastic IP
- Allows to attach a fixed ipv4 address to an instance, even if stopped.
- It has ongoing cost, even if not attached to an instance 

### IPv6
- A lot more addresses than ipv4
- All Ipv6 addresses are public

## What is a VPC?
- Private network to deploy resources.
- It is linked to a specific region
- It has a CIDR range =>

### Subnet
- A subnet is a partion of the VPC
- It is associated with an availability zone.
- A public subnet => subnet that can be accessed from the internet => You would put a Load Balancer
- Private subnet => Not accessible from the internet => Good to put Databases for example.

### Route tables
Are used to define access to the internet and between other subnets.
