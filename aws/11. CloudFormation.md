# Cloud Formation

Definition: Cloud Formation => Infrastructure as code

Benefits
- A declarative way of outlining infrastructure for any AWS resources.
- Avoid setting infrastructure manually, everything is code (Excellent for control)
- Cloud formation creates resources in the right order, with the exact configuration you specify.
- Cost advantage: Resources get similar tag so you can sew how much the infrastructure costs you
- You can estimate the cost using CloudFormation template
- Saving strategies: Set resources at specific times.

Productivity:
- Detroy and recreate infastructure on the fly.
- Automated generation of Diagrams for templates
- Declarative programming (No need to figure out ordering or orchestration)

Dont reinvent the wheel
- LEverage existing templates on the web
- Leverage documentation

For exam: We use Cloud formation when we need to repeat an infrastructure in different env, regions or aws accounts.
