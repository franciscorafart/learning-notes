# Cloud Formation

Definition: Cloud Formation => Infrastructure as code

Benefits
- A declarative way of outlining infrastructure for any AWS resources.
- Avoid setting infrastructure manually, everything is code (Excellent for control)
- Cloud formation creates resources in the right order, with the exact configuration you specify.
- Cost advantage: Resources get similar tag so you can sew how much the infrastructure costs you
- You can estimate the cost using CloudFormation template
- Saving strategies: Set resources at specific times.

Productivity:
- Detroy and recreate infastructure on the fly.
- Automated generation of Diagrams for templates
- Declarative programming (No need to figure out ordering or orchestration)

Dont reinvent the wheel
- LEverage existing templates on the web
- Leverage documentation

For exam: We use Cloud formation when we need to repeat an infrastructure in different env, regions or aws accounts.

### Hands on Cloud Formation
For example on course (Cloud formation stack has to be createdin us-east-1 (Virginia))

- You can create a template or upload one with a `.yaml` file. A template is a yaml file.
- Once you have it you can estimate the cost (going away soon)

- When creating a Stack from a template, you'll be able to see all the processes going on (CREATE_IN_PROGRESS, UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, etc)
- When updating a stack you can change the template by uploading (or pushing) a new one.
- Change Set: Section to visualize what Cloud Formation will do when we change the Stack.
- Update Clean up: Once Cloud Formation updates it cleans up automatically, meaning we don't have to go and manually remove resources previously created.
- Delete Stack: Clears all the resources created for the stack, and deletes in the right order.

A good Cloud Fromation template can be deployed and re-depoyed in multiple regions and accounts.

### CDK (Cloud development kit)

A way to define your infrastructure using a familiar language: JS/TS, Python, Java, .NET instead of using .yaml files
- The code is compiled bythe CDK into a Cloud Formation template (JSON/Yaml)
- CCK CLI Allows to deploy runtime and infrastructure code at the same time
- Great for lambda functions, Docker Containers on ECS
