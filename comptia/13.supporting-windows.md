## OS installation and upgrades

OS Installation process puts files in installation media into a drive's partition.

Types of installation:

### Clean install or in-place upgrade
`Attended installation`: Prompts to set up OS configurations:
- Clean Install: Install OS on new PC or overwriting existing OS by repartitioning or formatting disk. Everything wiped.
    - More reliable
    - Backup files before clean install
    - Requires boot media
- In-place upgrade: Running setup from existing version of OS => 
    - Settings, third-party apps are kept
    - Mostly for home users
    - Much faster than clean install

### Upgrade considerations
1. Hardware compatibility: Sufficient resources to run the new OS.
2. Application and driver support/backwards compatibility
 - Incompatible software or hardware should be uninstalled before attempting in-place upgrade. Incompatible apps and drivers would have to be replaced.
 - Microsoft maintains a `LPL` (Logo'd Product List) catalog with tested devices and drivers (previously HCL - Hardware Compatibility List)
    - Automated Upgrade Advisor can check if Applications and Hardware will be compatible with new Windows version

3. Backup files and user preferences
- Security backup for in-place upgrade or torestore data and settings after clean install

4. Obtain thrid-party drivers
OS setup might not have drivers for certain hardware devices -> Usually only an issue for RAID controllers. If controller driver not available setup program won't be able to use RAID controller.
- Save drivers for hardware on USB stick for easy installation after upgrade. Windows setup media has drivers, but are often not updated.

### Feature Updates
- `Feature updates` paradigm to introduce changes in Windows 10 & 11: `product lifecycle` => Delivered via Windows update.
- Better to treat a Feature Update as an in-place upgrade, though rarely it produces hardware problems => Check for hardware and Software compatibility concerns

## Unattended Installations
Attended installations are slow, and too much for large deployments
There are several ways of doing unattended installations of the OS:

- Answer file
    - Uses a script or configuration file to input choices and settings => In Windows it's called the `answer file`
    - Windows System Image Manager used to configure `answer file`
- Image deployment
    - Image is a copy of an existing installation of the OS stored on a file
    - Image can container settings, applications, service packs, etc => Can be stored in USB or DVD
    - Consistent set of software and configuration options

    - Before imaging we need `SysPrep` utiliy - Windows generates a new SID (Security Identifier) every time we deploy that image
    - We also need an Answer File to automate the process => Done on Windows System Image Manager utility

**TODO: Run commands from video on Windows system**

## Boot Devices
Boot device => how setup program, answer file, and OS file or System Image is loaded onto traget PC. Has to bee set up to the higherst priority on computer's firmware.

### Optical media
Historicaly Attended installations are done from a CD or DVD.

### USB, External Drives, and Flash drives
- Disc not common these days
- Disc based installations quickly become out of date => post-installation tasks can take longer than original installation
- We can build a more current image and put it in a USB drive
- `Media Creation Tool` is utility to create bootable USB drives or an ISO image for a CD.

### Network Boot
- Connecting to shared folder containing installation files (slipstreamed or image deployment)
- PCs come with PXE - Preboot Execution Environement => compliant formware and network adapter that supports network boot.
- Client uses DHCP to locate suitable configured server with installation files

### Internet-based boot
- Local DHCP must be condifured to supply DNS name of installation server
- Most setup installers need to connect to the internet to download packages

### Internal Hard drive - partition
- Once OS installed, set internal hard drive as highest priority boot device => System doesn't boot install again
- In addition, an internal partition can be used as recovery partition

## Disk Configuration
- Disk requires partitioning and formatting before it can be used
- Partition is logically separate storage area in disk => At least one partition before formatting to create a file system

Two types of Partition information:
1. MBR - Master Boot Record
- Stores partition table on first 512-byte sector
- Up to 4 primary partitions, with one marked as active (bootable) => 4 differen drives on physical disk and multiple OSs
- Each drive can be formatted with a different file system

- Start of each primary partition contains `boot sector` or PBR Partition Boot Record
- Record that point to the OS boot loader
- In Windows referred to System Partition or System Reserved
- Boot partition => drive containing Windows OS files => Doesn't have to be the same as the syste drive
- ***When using MBR, firmware must be set to use legacy BIOS boot method.*** => Can't be UEFI, disk won't be recognized as boot device

2. GPT-Style Partitioning
- Global UID Partition table
- Addresses limitations of MBR
- Support for +4 primary partitions: Windows supports 128 with GPT
- Supports larger partitions +2TB and backup copy of partition entrues
- Protective MBR for compatibility with devices that don't recognize GPT    
- *** Firmware must be set to UEFI boot method *** => Can't be BIOS, disk won't be recognized as boot device

### Drive Format
- OS must be installed in a drive format compatible with File system
    - Windows: NTFS
    - MAC: APFS
    - Linux: ext3 or ext4
- Partition and formatting choces guided through instalation

## Repair Installation
When PC can't boot or slow performance without a single cause.

### Recovery Partition
- Recovery partition is tool (OEM recovery media) able to reset system to factory configuration
- Created on internal fixed drive
- If main installation doesn't boot, we can select recovery partition to boot system on the firmware => Simple Wizard process replaces damaged installation
- OEM media doesn't recover user data, settings or applications => Backup before
- Disadvantages:
    - Only works with if original hard disk is still installed
    - Doesn't onclude service patches or packs applied between shipping date and recovery date
    - Recovery Image uses a lot of space

### Reset Windows
- Refresh and reset copies to try repairing the installation
- Recopies System files and reverts system settings => Can preseve user data files and Windows Store apps. Desktop applications removed.
- Full reset wil delete OS, apps, data => Ready for OS to be reinstalled

# Install and Configure applications

## System Requirements for applications

1. CP possible requirements
- 32 or 64 bit OS.
- TPM or Vritualization

2. RAM -> Of programa running by itself.
3. Storage
4. Dedicated Graphics card => Games likely to require dedicated Graphics card and video RAM
5. External Hardware Token => Smart card or USB for secure authentication (like an iLok)

## OS requirements for applications
- All software design to run under specific OS -> In Linux not usually an issue f compatibility between distros
- App designed for 32 or 64 bit OS. 32 will run on 64, not in reverse

In Windows: 32-bit programas are installed in `Program Files (x86)` and 64-bit ones in `Program Files`
DDLs and Exe stored in => 64-bit %SystemRoot%\system32, 32-bit stored in  %SystemRoot%\syswow64.

## Distribution Methods
- Distribution method: otical disk, download, image files, thumb drive
- Many apps published through app stores
- Desktop apps via setup file: exe or msi (Windows), dmg or pkg (MacOs), DEB for APT (package manager) or RMP for YUM (Linux)
- When downloading software => Verify Authenticity and Integrity of package.
    - Windows -> Digital signature
    - Linux -> Hash (Generate own hash to compare with published hash)
- ISO file => Content of optical disk on a single file => Often used for Virtual Machine installation
    - Windows: Right click and select Mount

## Other Considerations
- IT pro needs to evaluate potential impacts of installing third-party software: Avoid unsanctioned software and devices (Shadow IT)

### Impact to business
Applications installed need to be supported

- Licensing: Using unlicensed software exposes company to legal and financial penalties
- Support: Either external or internal to the company, needs to be assesed
- Training: Users need to learn how to use Apps and their updates.

### Impact to operations
- Use of automated tools to deploy, update, and support application to x number of machines
    - Use of Network-based installer
    - Group Policy Objects(GPOs) => To set a PC to remotely and automatically install an application from network folder.
    - Centrally managed software (ex. Antivirus) can be `pushed` to the clients machine
    - Advantage: User doesn't have to log to local client with admin privileges

### Impact to device or to Network
- Consideratons on impact to device and network when installing application
- Main threat => Trojan (hidden malware)
    - Malware => Steals data or provides remote access to host or network
    - Install only from trusted sources and that code is digitally signed
- Software can impact stability and performance of host and network:
    - Compatibility problems
    - Cpu or memory consumption
    - Security vulnerabilities in the software
    - Applications should be tested in a LAB environment before being deployed

# Trobleshoot Windows OS problems

## Boot process
1. POST -> 2. Identify boot device -> 3. Passes control to OS boot loader process

### Bios process
2. Firmware scans disk and read MBR from in first sector of disk
3. MBR identifies boot sector from partition marked as active
4. Boot sector loads boot manager (BOOTMGR.EXE)
5. Boot manager reads data from Boot Configuration File (BCD) -> Identifies OS installed on computer
- BOOTMGR.EXE and BCD normally installed into hidden system.
6. Boot manager loads Windows boot loader WINLOAD.EXE stored in system root folder

### UEFI process
2. Firmware reads GUID partition table (GPT) on the boot device
3. GPT identifies EFI System Partition => EFI partition contains EFI boot manager an BCD
- Each Windows installation has BCD and BOOTMGFW.EFI
4. BOOTMGFW.EFI reads BCD to show a boot menu or find location of WINLOAD.EFI

### Common
7. Windows loads the Kernel (NTOSKRNL.EXE), hardware abstraction layer (HAL.DLL) and boot device drivers
8. Control passes to Kernel and load the process -> when finished WINLOGON process waits for user to authenticate

## Boot recovery tools
We need options and recovery tools to access an env to run tests and attempt fixes

### Advanced Boot Option
Menu that appears automatically if system doesn't load or invoked manually
- Selection fo different start up modes
-  Select `Troubleshoot -> Advanced Options -> Startup settings` and select an option

Options:
#### Safe Mode
- Troubleshooting mode that loads only basic drivers and services necessary to start the system
- Isolates reliability ad performance problems to ad-in drivers or applications without reinstalling Windows
- Good to run analysis tools: chdsk, System Restore, antiviruses

### WinRE and Startup Repair
If not possible to boot computer:
- We can boot from product media, repair disk, or recovery partition
- We can also make a System Repair disk using Create a recovery drive (do it before computer starts boot failing)
- Select `Troubleshoot -> Advanced Options -> Startup Repair` to try to fix boot problems if boot files damaged.
- Also `Troubleshoot -> Advanced Options -> System Restore` 

LAst options:
1. Run Memory diagnostic an drop it in Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) command prompt. Run commands like:
`diskpart` `sfc` `bootrec` `bcedit` `regedit`

## System Restore
- System Restore allows to roll back Windows configuration settings to diffrent points in time
- Doesn't restore or delete user data

### Configuring System Protections
- Select wich disk to use on the `System settings -> System Protection tab`
- Disk must be formatted with NTFS and have at least 1GB in size
- Restore points are created automatically in response to application and update installs (Also manually or on Task Scheduler)

### Using System Restore
- Open System restore rstrui.exe or run Repair your Computer from recovery environment
- It restores passwords to what they were at the point of the recovery

## Update and Driver Roll back

### Update fail
If an update fails:
Option 1: System Restore
Option 2: `Programs and Features -> View Installed Updated -> Uninstall`

### Driver Rollback
If a driver update breaks the device:
Roll back Driver feature: `Device Manager -> Properties -> Driver Tab -> Roll Back Driver button`

## System Repair, Reinstall, Reimage

System repair or Reintall and restore from backup when System Restore, Startup Repair don't work and user can't boot.

### Create and use Recovery Image
- You can make a complete backup of system configurations and backup with an Image
- Need a backup device with capacity
- To create a System Image: `Control Panel -> Backup and Restore -> Create System Image`
- To recover system using image: `Advanced boot option` or `System Image Recovery` option off a repair disk

### Reinstalling Windows
If no backup image, reinstall Windows: `Reset this PC` option in recovery environment
Options:
    - Keep my files -> Local setup cache or downloading them from Microsoft's Cloud servers
    - Remove everything

* Remove everything option if you're giving up ownership of PC

## Troubleshoot boot isses

General technique to troubleshoot boot issues: Determine failure point (Missing or corrupt file)

### Failure to boot / Invalid boot disk
- `No boot device` or `Invalid Boot disk` error => System completely failed to boot
    - Common cause: Leaving Firmware to boot from USB
    - Old cause: Floppy disk in on a restart
    - Check removable disks and change priority boot list
    - Check connections of drive if failing to boot from Disk
    - If error intermittend => Sign that disk is close to failing

### No OS Found
- When Disk found but no location for OS loader => Could be faulty disk (run `chkdsk` to run diagnostic)

- If disk not detected => Modify settings in System Setup
- If disk detected bu system not booting => Use startup repair tool to open recovery mode, use `bootrec` to try repair device's boot information.
   - Enter `bootrec /fixmbr` => attempt to repair MBR (Not for GPT partitioning)
   - `bootrec /flxboot` => Attempt repair of boot sector
   - `bootrec /rebuildbdc` to add missing Windows installations and boot configuration database (BCD)

### Graphical interface fails to load / Black screen

- If Windows boots but no sign-in screen or desktop doesn't load folowing logon => Corruption of drivers or other system files
- If it boots in Safe Mode => Replace graphics adapter driver

Black screen issues (Prone in Windows)
- Often in update processes -> Give the system time to complete update
- WINDOWS+CTRL+SHIFT+8 => Check if system is responsive.
- use `chkdsk` and `sfc` to verify system file registry integrity
- Consider update or rollback of graphics adapter driver

## Troubleshooting Profile Issues
- Slow loading => Enable Verbose status messages in `Display highly detailed status message` in registry settings
- Delays prior to sign ins => usually drivers and services loading
- Deay post user sign-in => Corrupt user profile, specially NTUSER.DAT
    - Rebuild local user profile => Create new account and copy files from old, corrupt profile, excluding: NTUSER.DAT, NTUSER.DAT.LOG, NTUSER.INI

## Troubleshoot Performance issues

Procedures to identify causes of slugish performance

1. Task Manager: Are there processes on 90-100%? Identify particular Windows processes with `svchost.exe`. 
    Common culprits: Windows Update/Installer, SuperFetch, Windows Telemetry, Windows Search/Indexing, Windows Defender, third-party software
2. Wait for process to complete. If it stays at 90-100% it could have stalled
3. Continued unresponsiveness => Restart the service or kill the process
4. If no luck, reboot the system. Better: turn off machine and wait 30s to clear cache.
5. If still sluggish, disable the process if possible.
6. If `Low Memory` message run fewer programs and try to insulate which process is the problem (Could be app memory leak). If not, system might need more RAM.
7. If `Low Disk Space` error, use disk clean-up utility.

Other troubleshooting techniques:
- Apply udpdates
- Defragment HDD
- Verify OS and app hardware requirements
- Disable start up items `msconfig` ir Task Manager to prevent programs from running at startup
- Scan computer for Viruses and Malware, or disable Anti-Virus temporarily.
- Check power management issues => Restart PC if too much hybernate or sleep. Verify system not in power-saving mode => Check overheating

## Trobleshoot System Fault issues

BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) => Windows STOP error.
Most of the time faulty hardware or hardware drivers (also corrupt system files)

- Use System Restore driver rollback, or update rollback to restore system to working state
- Remove recent hardware or uninstall recent program
- Run hardware diagnostics, chdsk, and scan malware
- Check fans and chasis vents for dust
- Make note of STOP error and consult Microsoft's documentation

### System Instability and frequent shutdowns
Usually due to overheating, power, CPU, Chipset, RAM, or corrupt Kernel files.

- `Administrative tools -> Windows Memory Diagnostics` => test memory chips for errors
- If errors, check all memory modules correctly installed one by one
- If file corruption is suspect -> Run `chkdsk` and `stc /verifyonly` ti scan Windows System files

### USB issues
- If any issues make sure controllers using latest drivers
- Windows Update or vendor's site to get latest chip set or system driver
- Device Manager to uninstall USB controller device and reboot to install with new driver
- If not solver, disable USB selective suspend power

- USB controller resource warning: Too many devices on one controller,

If update chipset drivers doesn't work:
1.  Connect hubs to USB2 ports, reserve USB3 for external disks and network adapters
2. Reduce number of devices or test to see if one specific device is the problem

## Troubleshoot application and Service Fault issue

### Application crashing
- When apps crash priority is preserving data
- Users should be trained to save regulary
- Use Windows File History or OneCloud
- Give process time to finish, if not use Task Manager to end process. Check logs if app crashed continually.
- If no solution, try appication update if available or uninstall and reinstall.

### Services not starting
- if `One or more services failed to start` message => Check Event Viewer or Services snap-in to identify failing service
General advice:
- Restart service manually or make a delayed start if not necessary
- Check that disabling a service doesn't affect others
- Make sure service has sufficient privileges
- If core Windows service affected, check system files and scan disks for errors and malware
- If app service affected, reinstall application
- Look for orphaned services left by faulty uninstalls

### Time Drift
Client and server can drift out of sync if Real-time clock on Motherboard drifts off due to lack of battery

- RTC not a reliable source of time
- Time drift can affect authentication and backup
- Servers and clients can be configured to use internet Time source
- Ideally network resources should use GPS-sync time sources or pool of internet source.
