# Configure Mobile OS security
- Mobile device security must be specified via policies, procedures, and training.

## Screen locks

- Access to a mobile device is huge security risk => Cached passwords, VPN, stored files, texts, emails, etc.
- Screen lock: If devices unused or users locks it

Authentication mechanisms to unlock screen:
1. PIN - Personal Identification number or Password
    - Primary or backup authentication method
2. Fingerprint
3. Facial recognition => Template computed from 3D image of user's face
4. Pattern: Join the dots => Vulnerable, easy to observe and predictable shapes

- Failed login attempts => Device locks if number of failed attempts. Deters guessing the password or spoofed biometrics.

## Mobile security software
### Patching / OS updates

- As important as on desktop devices
- iOS generally easier to maintain software up to date
- Android depends on vendor as the have to make patch for flavor of Android

### Antivirus / Anti-malware apps
- Emerging nature of mobile OS makes it difficult to create pattern databases or to use heuristics to identify suspicious behaviors
- They tend to work more as content filters to block access to known phishing sites and block adware

## Enterprise Mobile Management

Mobile device Deployment Model => Way employees are provided with mobile devices and applications

1. BYOD
    - Owned by employee
    - Must meet requirements set by the company (OS + functionality)
    - Employee will agree on installation of coroprate apps
    - Model prefered by employees but more challenging for security and network managers

2. Coroprate Owned, Business Only (COBO)
3. Coroprate owned, personally enabled (COPE)
    - Device chosen and supplied by company
    - Can be used for personal things, within policies of corporation
4. Choose your own device (CYOD)
    - Employees are given a list of possible devices
    - Supplied by the company
    - Can be used for personal things

### MDM - Mobile Device Management
- Enterprise software to apply security policies to smartphones and tablets in business networks
- Can be used to managed corporate-owned devices and BYOD
- Device can be managed with policies to restrict use of Apps, built-in devices (Camera or Microphone), ensuring updated OS, and correct Firewall configuration.
    - Example: Microsoft Intune => Can be used to allow or prohibit apps
- `Profile of security requirements`: To be applied to different employees and sites

## Mobile Data Security
In case device is lost, there are ways of protecting data and misuse

### Device encryption
- Most OS provide a basic level of encryption

Types of Encryption iOS:
    - Data on device is always encrypted, key stored on device. => To wipe out device, just delete key
    - Data Protection: 
        - Email Data and apps using Data Protection => Second round of encryption using key derived and protected from user's credentials. 
        - Not for contacts, SMS, pictures.
        - Configured by default when passlock code is configured

Types of Ecnryption Android:
- As of Android 10, no full-disk encryption
    - Detrimental to performance and can make some apps not work correctly
    - User data encrypted at `file-level` by default when secure screen lock configured

### Remote backup applications
- OS can be configured for automatic backups of data and settings with vendor's cloud solution => iCloud, OneDrive, Google Sync
- Backup can be provided with third party platform (Dropbox)
- Backups can be done to PC or MacOS
- Devices can be backed up with MDM software as well.

## IOT Security

IoT: Global network of persona devices, home appliances, home control systems, vehicles and devices equipped with sensors, software, and network connectivity
- IoT devices can exchange information among themselves and with computers

### Home automation systems
Components IoT smart device:
-Hub/control system:
    - Communication hub required to facilitate wireless networking
    - Control system required: Most IoT devices are headless. (Ex. Smart speaker operated from phone)
- Smart device types
    - IoT endpoints (final device) operate the function
    - These devices are vulnerable to exploits
    - Most use Linux or Android Kernel, They run mini computers => Vulnerable to standard attacks
- Wireless mesh networking
    - Communication between devices uses some type of mesh networking (Z-Wave or Zigbee). Communication to central hub to wifi network.
    - Wireless standards use (Z-wave and Zigbee) use less power and make it easier to forward packages between devices
    - Remote or out of network communication with devices can increase attack surface

### Secutiry concerns
- Consumer grade IoT devices poorly documented and patch management from vendors inadequate.
- Weak defaults for residential use (default admin password)
- In corporate env, Shadow IT=> Deployment of network-enabled device without configration management process.
    - Vulnerability in device puts it at risk of being exploited as access point to network
    - Risks mitigated by regular audits and employee security awareness training

# Trobleshoot Mobile OS and App Software
- Apps, OS, and hardware tightly integrated in mobile devices => Trobuleshooting 3 at the same time
    - iOS => Common problem with apps is the need for OS update
        - In house apps the opposite, you have to wait for OS updates

## Mobie Device Troubleshooting

- Most trobuleshooting happens on Seetings app => Control Center (iOS - swipe from top-right) and Settings (Android- Swipe from top)

### Reboot
- Reboot can resolve transitory performance or stability issues on a mobile device as well =? Powering of clears RAM and closes applications.
    - Ex. Frozen apps, unresponsive digitizer
    - Androids can be booted in Safe mode => Disables third-party apps but leaves core services running

### Factory Reset
- Removes all user data, apps, and settings => Ensure fully charged or connected to power
- Device restored manually or from backup configuration
- Reset iOS => `General > Settings`
- REst Android => Check instructions for particular device. In general => `System > Settings > Advanced`

## Troubleshoot device and OS issues

- If device reboot doesn't fix issues:

### OS fails to update
- Use Vendors site to verify OS update compatible with device
- Connect device to power => OS update can be blocked if insufficient battery
- Restart and try updating again
- Check sufficient free space on device. iOS: `Settings > General > Storage` Android: `Settings > Storage`

### Device randomly reboots
- Causes: Overheating, low battery, faulty battery or hardware
- Check battery health
- Check hardware faults with third party software
- Check deviec has sufficient storage
- Insulate the issue to single faulty app and uninstall

### Device is slow to respond
- Discard throttling (overheating) and low battery charge
- Too many apps open
- Badly written apps => Overuse of memory
- Insulate apps that cause major resource consumption
- Battery settings => Research which app uses most resources
- Third party app can monitor utilization
- Sometimes OS updates can affect performance of older devices => Vendors tend to not provide rollback options

### Screen not autorotating

- Check rotation lock not enabled
- Check user is not touching other part of the screen
- COnsider apps that can only be used on single orientation => Could interfere with other apps
    - Close apps via task list

### Troubleshoot app issues
-Mobile OS does sophisticated memory management to keep multiple apps running. It shifts them between:
    - Foreground (in active use)
    - Background (Maybe accessing netwowrk and resources)
    - Suspended (Not using resources)

- If app fails to launch, close, or crashes => Force stop and launch it again
    - Android: `Settings > Apps > Force Stop`
    - iOS: Clear app from multitasking list => Swipe up

If not:
- Clear app cache. Android: Clear Cache option under App info
- Uninstall and reinstall it

- Consider MDM policies might prevent app from functioning properly (Ex. prevent use of camera, location).
- If it doesn't update via wireless, connect it to a PC/Mac and manage it from there.

## Trobleshoot connectivity issues

- WiFi or Bluetooth on a mobile device

### Singal strength and interference issues
- Radio is less powerful on mobile device, and low battery will weaken it => Move it closes to AP and avoid walls, cases

### Configuration issues
- Check device not in Airplane mode and radio function not been disabled
- Verify WiFi network parameters and Bluetooth pairing info is correct
- Verify AP supports same 802.11 standard as device => Put adapter in compatibility mode if needed
    - Some mobile devices only support 2.4GHz and can't connect to 5GHz band
- Consider OS or firware update and AP

### Troubleshoot NFC (Near-field communications)
- Typically when trying to make payments
- Device needs to be unlocked and payment via NFC enabled
- Verify Airplane mode not active
- Hold device closer to reader

### Troubleshoot AirDrop issues (iOS)
- Transfer between iOS and macOS devices via bluetooth, Wifi or cellular.
- Sender must be in recipients's contact list
- Check feature enabled and correctly configured `Settings > General > Airdrop`
- Ensure Wifi and bluetooth turned on
- Android supports similar feature called `Nearby Share`

# Troubleshoot mobile OS and App Security

- Close integration app, hardware, OS => Security models more restrictive than many Desktop systems

## Root Access Security concerns

- User account creader during setup (iOS and Android) 
    - Can install apps and congiure settings
    - Can't make system-level changes

Circumventing these limitations requires privilege escalation:
- Root Access:
    - Associated to Android devices
    - Some vendors provide authorized mechanisms for root account on device
    - For some it's required to exploit a vulnerability or use custom firmware.
- Jailbreak
    - iOS much more restrictive than Android
    - Jailbreak: Exploits that allow user to obtain root privileges, sideload apps, add carriers, customize interface
    - Achieved by booting the device with patched Kernel
    - Some exploutscan be done only when device attached to computer (Thethered jailbreak)

- Implies subverting security controls of OS to gain system-level access and leaving some security measures permanently disabled
- If user has root permission => Any software running on device is compromised.
- MDMs have routines to detect jailbreaked or rooted devices or custom firmware without proper signatures.
- Developer mode should only de used for actual app development and not enabled routinely
    - DEveloper mode can be misused to install bootleg apps
    - MDM can block devices on developer mode.

## Mobile App Source Security Concerns

- Trusted app sources:
    - Authorize valid developers
    - Issues certificates to sign their apps
    - May analyze code submitted to ensure security and good privacy practies
    - Control content
    - Prevent duplicate functions from OS core apps

### App Spoofing
- App stores can be target of Rougue developers trying to publish spyware apps
- Malicious app publishes with similar name to legitimate app to attempt spoofing
- VPN, antivirus and dating apps common targets
- CAution installing apps even when approved by stores

### Enterprise apps and APK Sideloding

- AppStore / PlayStore model doesn't work well for enterprises sometimes
    - Not appropiate to deliver custo corporate app via public store
    - Apple has enterprise developer and distribution problems for this via Apple Business Manager (MDM)
    - Google has Managed Google Play => Allows MDM to push apps from private channel to device
- Sideloading: Android allows different stores and installation of untrusted app => Can be downloaded and installed via APK format
    - Weakens device security
    - MDM can be used to prevent use of third-party stores and block them

### Bootleg App Stores
- Bootleg app: Pirates or closely mimcs legitimate app
- To pirate popular apps without paying for them
    - License and copyright infringement
    - Exposure to malware
    - iOS => Using developer mode is a way of installing apps from outside the App store without jailbreaking device.

## Mobile Security Symptoms
- AV software on mobile OS unreliable => Pay attention to symptoms
1. High number of ads
2. Fake security warnings (scareware)
3. Sluggish response time or fast battery drain
    - Malware likely collects data or performs cryptomining
4. Limited / no internet connectivity
    - Malware corrupts DNS to perform redirections and force spoofed sites

### Unexpected app behavior
- Bootleg or spoofed app acts as a trojan => Operates in the background to harvest data from device.
    - Ex. Request for permissions or access to camera / microphone
    - High network traffic if app copying files from device.
    - Excessive bandwidth: DEvice used as DDOS, mass maiking, cryptominig => Use monitor and limit of data usage features.

### Leaked Personal Files / Data
- Data leaks can lead to further threat actor intrusion
- If device copromised => Quarantined
- Enable 2-step verification when new devices log in to account
- Possiblity of thedt of personal information
- Unauthorized location tracking => Information to third parties
- Strip geotagging information and all etadata from pictures shared online
