# Configure Mobile OS security
- Mobile device security must be specified via policies, procedures, and training.

## Screen locks

- Access to a mobile device is huge security risk => Cached passwords, VPN, stored files, texts, emails, etc.
- Screen lock: If devices unused or users locks it

Authentication mechanisms to unlock screen:
1. PIN - Personal Identification number or Password
    - Primary or backup authentication method
2. Fingerprint
3. Facial recognition => Template computed from 3D image of user's face
4. Pattern: Join the dots => Vulnerable, easy to observe and predictable shapes

- Failed login attempts => Device locks if number of failed attempts. Deters guessing the password or spoofed biometrics.

## Mobile security software
### Patching / OS updates

- As important as on desktop devices
- iOS generally easier to maintain software up to date
- Android depends on vendor as the have to make patch for flavor of Android

### Antivirus / Anti-malware apps
- Emerging nature of mobile OS makes it difficult to create pattern databases or to use heuristics to identify suspicious behaviors
- They tend to work more as content filters to block access to known phishing sites and block adware

## Enterprise Mobile Management

Mobile device Deployment Model => Way employees are provided with mobile devices and applications

1. BYOD
    - Owned by employee
    - Must meet requirements set by the company (OS + functionality)
    - Employee will agree on installation of coroprate apps
    - Model prefered by employees but more challenging for security and network managers

2. Coroprate Owned, Business Only (COBO)
3. Coroprate owned, personally enabled (COPE)
    - Device chosen and supplied by company
    - Can be used for personal things, within policies of corporation
4. Choose your own device (CYOD)
    - Employees are given a list of possible devices
    - Supplied by the company
    - Can be used for personal things

### MDM - Mobile Device Management
- Enterprise software to apply security policies to smartphones and tablets in business networks
- Can be used to managed corporate-owned devices and BYOD
- Device can be managed with policies to restrict use of Apps, built-in devices (Camera or Microphone), ensuring updated OS, and correct Firewall configuration.
    - Example: Microsoft Intune => Can be used to allow or prohibit apps
- `Profile of security requirements`: To be applied to different employees and sites

## Mobile Data Security
In case device is lost, there are ways of protecting data and misuse

### Device encryption
- Most OS provide a basic level of encryption

Types of Encryption iOS:
    - Data on device is always encrypted, key stored on device. => To wipe out device, just delete key
    - Data Protection: 
        - Email Data and apps using Data Protection => Second round of encryption using key derived and protected from user's credentials. 
        - Not for contacts, SMS, pictures.
        - Configured by default when passlock code is configured

Types of Ecnryption Android:
- As of Android 10, no full-disk encryption
    - Detrimental to performance and can make some apps not work correctly
    - User data encrypted at `file-level` by default when secure screen lock configured

### Remote backup applications
- OS can be configured for automatic backups of data and settings with vendor's cloud solution => iCloud, OneDrive, Google Sync
- Backup can be provided with third party platform (Dropbox)
- Backups can be done to PC or MacOS
- Devices can be backed up with MDM software as well.
