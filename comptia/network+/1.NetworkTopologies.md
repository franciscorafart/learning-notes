- OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model divides Network into 7 functional layers

# Network Topologies

## Networking Concepts
- Network: Two or more computer systems linked by a transmission medium and sharing protocol that allws them to exchange data: 
- Nodes and Links
    - Intermediate nodes: forarding functions
    - End-system nodes: Send and receive data

### Client-server vs Peer-to-peer
- Client-server: Most devices are clients and server is a more powerfull device that provides resources (Ex. Business networks)
- Peer-to-peer: Each host acts as both client and server. Decentralized (Ex. Residential)

### Appliances, applications and functions
- Appliance: Computer with an OS or software designed to execute a particular network role. Switch, router, AP, Firwall, LB, proxies.
- It can be physical device or virtual software appliance
- Applications: Nodes deployed to provide services that allows network to do useful work.
- Functions: Networks can have different properties to perform functions like VPN or QoS
