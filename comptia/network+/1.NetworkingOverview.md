# Networking Overview
- OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model divides Network into 7 functional layers

# 1. Network Topologies

## Networking Concepts
- Network: Two or more computer systems linked by a transmission medium and sharing protocol that allws them to exchange data: 
- Nodes and Links
    - Intermediate nodes: forarding functions
    - End-system nodes: Send and receive data

### Client-server vs Peer-to-peer
- Client-server: Most devices are clients and server is a more powerfull device that provides resources (Ex. Business networks)
- Peer-to-peer: Each host acts as both client and server. Decentralized (Ex. Residential)

### Appliances, applications and functions
- Appliance: Computer with an OS or software designed to execute a particular network role. Switch, router, AP, Firwall, LB, proxies.
- It can be physical device or virtual software appliance
- Applications: Nodes deployed to provide services that allows network to do useful work.
- Functions: Networks can have different properties to perform functions like VPN or QoS

## Network Types
Netowrk type refers to size and scope of a network

### LAN
- Single geographical location
- All nodes connected with cables and short-range wireless tech
- Single organization: Residential, SOHO, Small and medium size enterprise (SME), Enterprise LAN, Datacenter.

### WAN
- Network of networs, connected by long-distanec links.
- Enterprise WAN: Connect main office with branches.
- Connect Datacenters to each other
- Likely use leased network devices and links, operated and managed by service provider.

## Network Topology
Topology defines physical or logical structure on network in terms of nodes and links

### Point-to-point (duplex)
- Two nodes connected to network media
- half duplex: Node can't send and receive at the same time
- Full duplex: Node can send and receive at the same time

### Star Topology
- Central node / concentrator (forwarding appliance like Switch or Router) where peripheral nodes connect to.
- Typical SOHO network
- Easy to configure and troubleshoot
- Conentrator is Single Point of failure
- Concentrator can forward messages to all nodes (Like a Hub) or selectively do it (like a Switch)
- Hub-and-spoke: Start topology used in WAN networks

### Mesh Topology
- Used in WANs
- Full-mesh: Each device has direct connection to all nodes. Impractical as it requires n*(n-1)/2 links, making it exponential.
- Partial mesh: Nodes can forward packets by learning network topology, avoiding links between all devices.
- Excelent redundancy, as multiple routes are available for a package.

# 1.2 Open System Interconnection (OSI) model
- Created by ISO, to promote understanding of how components in a network work.
- Separates functions of hardware and software into discrete layers.
- Not a standard or a specification. Functional guideline for designing network protocols, software, appliances.

Application - Presentation - Session - Transport - Network - Data Link - Physical

## 1.22 Data Encapsulation and Decapsulation

Network protocol => set of rules to exchange info in structured form.
- Two main functions: 
    Addressing: Where package of info should go
    Encapsulation: How messages should be packaged for transmition. Like the envelope of a message. 
- Same-layer interaction: Nodes communicating on a same OSI level with the same protocol.
- Adjacent-layer interaction: To communicate between layers, each layer provides services for the layer above, and uses services from layer below.
- Encapsulation: Sending node as a `header` to the data payload, forming a chunk of data called PDU (Protocol Data Unit) 
- Decapsulation: From Physical layer up. Extract Ethernet fram, then extracts IP address, all the way up to HTTP.
- Real world protocols don't conform exactly to OSI model.

## 1.23 Layer 1 - Physical
- Transmision of physical bits of data, cabled or wireless.
- Physical layer specifies:
    1. Physical topology. Layout of nodes. Area of larger network is called a Segment, were all nodes have access to same media.
    2. Physical interface: Mechaical specifications of cable (construction / pins) or specification of antenna and radio receiver (wireless).
    3. Signaling: Process of sending and receiving encoded data over the medium.

### Devices:
    - Tranceiver
    - Repeater
    - Hub
    - Media converter

## 1.24 Layer 2 - Data Link (Frame)
- Transfer of data between nodes in the same Segment, via hardware addresses (MAC)
- LANs usually don't connect directly in Mesh toology, but via a central node like a Switch or WAP that provides forwarding function.
- Organizes stream of bits into structured units calles `frames`. Each frame contains Network layer package and payload.
    - Includes source and destination hardware
- Assigns Destination hardware addres, source hardware addres, and checksum of basic error checking, to ensure integrity of frame.

### Devices
- Network Adapter Card (NIC)
- Bridge - Intermediate system that joins Physical network segment
- Switch: Advanced bridge with many ports. Efficient links between large humber of nodes.
- Wireless Access Point (AP): Allows bridges between wireless and wired networks.

## 1.25 Layer 3 - Network (Datagram)
- Move data on network of networks (internetwork) by using logical networks and host ids.
- Main appliance: Router.
- Each package has a destination network address
- Package is forwareded router to router (hop by hop)
- Firewalls operate at this layer to enforce ACL (Access Control List)

## 1.26 Layer 4 - Transport (Segment)
- End-to-end or host-to-host layer
- Identifies each type of network application by assigning port number
- At Transport layer, data from upper layers, series of PDUs or segments, tagged with application's port number.
- Port are invisible in Network and Data Link layers. Receiving host depasulates package and identifies it by its port number => Passed to relevant handler on application layer.

### Devices
- Multilayer switches (load balancers)
- Security appliances
- Advanced firewalls and instrusion detection systems (IDDs)

## 1.27 Upper Layers
- Associated to distinct real-world protocols. Interfaces between applications and the Transport layer.
- Upper layer services provide most of the services that make a network useful (web browsing, email, communication, directory, DB services)

### Layer 5 - Session
- Sequence of exchange messages that create a session or dialog, maintain it and close it.

### Layer 6 - Presentation
- Transforms data between the format required by the network and the format required by the application.
- Character conversion (ASCII and unicode)
- Data compression and encryption

### Layer 7 - Application
- Application protocols provide an interface for software programs and software hosts to have established communication channel.
