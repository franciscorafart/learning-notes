Networks are not made by connecting each device to others via cables, intermediary devices are used to establish local networks: Hubs, Bridges, and Switches.

## 3.1 Network Interfaces

Network Interface: Means by which node is connected to media and exchanges data with other network hosts.

## 3.1.1 Network Interface Cards
Network Interface Controller (NIC) / Network Adapter: Transceiver component that physically connects host to transmission medium.
    - Most support Gigabit ethernet
    - 10GbE and 40GBe at a price premium
    - Can provision multiple ports in same card 
    - Each device has a unique MAC (Media Access Control) address, or EUI (Extended Unique Identifier) or EA (Ethernet Address), also referred as unique physical address.

## 3.1.2 Modular Transceiver
Different modules have different connectors. Connectors establish connection at Physical layer.

### SFP/SFP+
- LC connector and supports Gigabit Ethernet
- Enhanced SFP (SFP+) supports 10GbE with LC form factor.

### QSFP / QSFP+
- Quad small form factor pluggable form factor that supports 4x1 Gbps
- Enhances QSFP (QSFP+) supports 40GbE for 4x10. Typically used with parallel fiber and multi-fiber push-on (MPO)
    - Can also be used with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) Ethernet Standard.

### Transceiver mismatch issues ???
- Modular transceiver designed for specific type of optical fiber. Mismatches can generate significant signal loss.
    1. Single mode fiber: Laser diodes
    2. Multi mode fiber: LED or different type of laser (VCSEL)

3 ways of deploying fiber - beside fiber mode:
- Duplex: Two strands transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx)
- Parallel multiple strands - 8 or 20 to implement Tx and Rx
- Wavelength Division Multiplex uses single bidirectional or dual unidirectional to implement multiple channels.

### Ethernet Frame Format
- Ethernet encapsulates payload from higher layer protocols in protocol data unit (PDU) called `Frame`
- Header fields in Ethernet frame: `Preamble - SFD - Destination MAC - Source MAC - Ether Type - Payload FCS`

#### Preamble:
Preamble and SFD (Start frame delimiter) used for clock sync.
- 8 bytes of alternat 1s and 0s
- SFD: two consecutive 1s at the end

#### EtherType
- Specifies type of protocol. IPv4 `0x0800`, IPv6 `0x86DD`

#### Error checking
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) - 32 bit (4 byte) checksum
- Calculated based on content of frames
- Receiving node performs same calculation and accepts if they match
