# Supporting network services

## File / Print servers
Core network function => Access to files and printing resources through a client-server architecture
Server => Machine hosting files or printers (Fileshare or print server)

Fileshare can be implemented with proprietary protocol for Windows Networks, or with TCP/IP protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

### Server Message Block (SBM)
- Application protocol in Windows networks
- Runs over port TCP/455
- Current version SBM-3 . SMB-1 disabled by default due to vulnerabilities
- Support for SBM in Unix / Linux via Samba software suite => Allows Windows client to access a Linux host
- SBM sometimes reffered as Common Internet File System (CIFS)

### Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS)
- Legacy network protocol for Windows
- Allows computers to refer to each other by name
- It was re-engineered to work over TCP and UDP protocols => NetBIOS over TCP (NetBT)
- NetBT uses UDP/137 for name services and TCP/139 for session services

### File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Allows clients to upload and download files from a network
- Associated to TCP/21
- TCP/20 to transfer data in active mode
- Unencrypted => Security flaw
- FTPS => Secure FTP
- SFTP => FTP over secure shell

## Web servers

### Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (http)

- Enables requests for an http server
- Port TCP/80 and TCP/433

### Hyper Text markup language (HTML)
- Plain text file that is interpreted by a browser to render a page
- POST request allow cients to send data to the server
- Extended by supporting scripts and programmable features (web apps)

### Uniform Resource Locators (URL)
- Access scheme to reach resources on the internet
- Protocol + FQDN + Filepath

### Web server develoyment

- Typically web servers are leased, but larger organization might host websites themselves.
- Intranets => Private networks using web technologies

## Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (https)
- http from early internet unencrypted and non-authenticated
- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) was developed by Netscape in the 90s to address this
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) was developed from Netscape's SSL and ratified by IETF
- TLS + HTTP => HTTPS over port TCP/433
- TLS can be used to secure other communication protocols such as FTP, POP3/IMAP, SMTP, LDAP

### SSL certificate
- To implement HTTPS an SSL certificate is installed on the server
- SSL certificate is issues by a Certificate Authority (who you must trust) => Server uses encrypted data to prove the identity of the server to the client
- The server has a private key and publishes the public key for clients to communicate with it => Encrypted tunnel
- Secure site url starts with https and shows a lock on the search bar

### Mail servers
