# Printers

## Unboxing and setup location

- Main technologies: inkjet, laser

### Properties of printers
- Page per minute (ppm): Varies depending on type of print.
- Maximum supported resolution: Dots-per-inch (DPI). Not the same as pixels per inch (ppi)
    - Horizontal resolution determined by printer engine
    - Vertical resolution determined by paper handling mechanism
- Paper handling: Types of paper and sizes
    - Overloading will cause paper jams => In high output situations like an office high load capacity is important
- Options and functionlities: Duplex unit (both sides paper automatically), finisher (folding, stabling, hole punching)

### Setup location
- Near power outlet with clear and well managed cables, on a flat surface
- Space for airflow, ventilation (for Ozone), and not in sunlight. Paper stored with no humidity or extreme temperatures
- Consider distruption to employees in its placement and if it prints confidential information

### Unboxing

- Handle with care
- Remove strips and supports of printers components before switching it on
- Leave printer to acclimate for 24 hrs before using to reduce risk of condensation. Same with paper.

## Print device connectivity

Printers support a range of connection interfaces

### USB
- Type B connector
- Usually PC will detect model of printer and install drivers automatically (Windows)
- Linux uses drivereless Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) for printers so no driver has to be installed

### Ethernet
- Most printers have an RJ-45 connector to get an IP from a DHCP server.
- Printer's IP can be stored on a host's DNS to connect via a FQDN (Fully qualified Domain Name)
- Network configuration on device's display or via a web interface

### Wireless Print Device Connectivity
- Either bluetooth or WiFi
- Two WiFi connections:
    1. Infrastructure Mode
    - Connect printer to AP and make it available to clients via an IP or FQDN
    2. WiFi direct
    - Configure software-implemented access point to print device

## Printer Drivers and Page Description Languages

- Printing apps are What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) => What you see in the screen is what gets printed out
- Different OSs using the printer will require suitable drivers
- Plug and Play (PnP) => Windows will usually select and install the appropiate driver
- Page Description Language (PDL): Raster file with instructions for printer to place dots on a page. PDL supports:
    - Scalable fonts: Fonts defined by vendors that can be scaled with flexibility (Not old bitmaps that supported specific font sizes)
    - Vector graphics: Instructions on how drwa an image insted of pixel-by-pixel Bitmap
    - Color printing: Printers use the reflective properties of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK) instead of the RGB of screen displays. PDL supports correct translation between on-screen color and print out.
- Choice of PDL depends on compatibility with software apps:  PostSCript (Adobe), Printer Control Language - PCL (HP)

## Printer Properties
- Drivers and Apps have default configuration for a printer

Windows
- Printer properties:
    Config for printer object and underlying hardware: sharing, port, driver update, duplex setup, default paper, default tray
    About Tab: Info on the printer and drivers
- Printe Preferences

## Printer Preferences
- Sets default print job options: paper orientation, color/black-white.
- Set for general or per=job basis

### Paper quality
- size and type of paper
- draft / normal mode (save ink)
- color / grayscale

### Finishing
- duplex option
- multiple images per sheet
- portrait / landscape

## Printer sharing
- Some printers have an embedded print server => Allows clients to connect directly without going through a computer or server
- Public printer: No access controls, any guest can use
- 
### Windows Print Server Configuration
- Any device with installed printer device can share tehe printer object with other computers
- Print server ca be connected to the printer over USB or network, giving administrator more control over who can use it.
- Printer object can have permissions enabled
- Share Sharing tab in printer properties
- If connected clients have different OS, you need to install the corresponding drivers
- Windows 10: Type 4 drivers => Single driver will work with multiple devices. Specific drivers are obtained by client via Windows Update instead of from print server.

### Shared Printer Connections

- Ordinary users can connect to printer if server admin gives them access => They can look for network on Network tab on file explorer

## Printer Security

Issues: Access to print services and print out of confidential material.

### User Authentication
- Print servers can be put behind user authentication to prevent unauthorized people from using it.
- They can be configured in Print Share
- Authentication could be in the device itself

### Secure Print and Badging
- Secured print => Held in the device until user authenticates
- Release authentication with: PIN, Badge (card reader)
- Secure prints are cached for a limited time

### Audit logs
- Device can be configred to log each job
- Used to identify printed documents or to identify unauthorized release of information
- Print-device logs can be configured to be sent to a centralized log server

## Scanner configuration

- Office printers are usually Multi-function devices (MFD), that include scanners
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) => Software to convert scanned text into characters for edit

### Scanner Types
- Flarbed scanner => Created bitmap of object by shining line at the object on a glass surface.
- Automatic Document Feeder => Passes Paper over fixed scan head (Better for multipage documents)

### Network Scan Devices
- MFD or standalone scanner be configured as a network device like a printer. On a network, scan output can be redirected:
    - Scan to email: Scanner must be configured with IP address of SMTP server
    - Server Message Block (SMB) or scan to folder: Scan stored as a file on a shared network folder.
    - Scan to cloud: File uploaded directly to cloud storage (Dropbox, OneDrive).

# Replace Print Device Consumables

## Laser Printer Imaging Process

- Cheap, fast, high quality
- Gray scale and color

1. Processing stage
Printer formatter board processes the page as bitmap (raster) and stores it in its RAM

2. Charging state
Imaging drum conditioned by the Primary Charge Roller (PCR), metal roller coated with rubber. PCT apples uniform 600V across the drum's surface.

3. Exposing stage
Photosensitive imaging drum looses charge when exposed to light. 
- Laser fires short pulse of light for each dot in raster and neutralizes charge given by the PCR.
- Pulsing light reflected with mirrors over the photosensitive imaging drum.
- Drum ends um with series of charge/no-charge dots that represent electrostatic latent image that is going to be printed.

4. Developing Stage
- Laser Toner fined compund of dyestuff (wax or plastic). Fed onto a magnetized `developer roller`
- Toner has same negative charge as imaging drum (wouldn't normally interact)
- When charge selectively removed from Imaging Drum, toner is attracter to them and sticks to those parts of the surface.
- Drum rotates to reach paper

5. Transfering stage
- Toner moves from drum into paper
- Picker roller picks up paper and Separation roller makes sure only one page is picked.
- Paper is fed to the transfer roller that applies a positive charge to one side of the paper => Attracts the toner on the drum
- Static eliminator (detac corona) removes charge from paper to avoid it sticking

6. Fusing Stage
- A Fusser assembly heats the paper to melt the toner into the page and squeezes it against a pressure roller.

7. Cleaning stage
- Photosensitive drum is cleaned of toner particles  using a cleaning blade, roller and electricity discharged
- Image Roller is smaller than a page so this process happens several times for a single page.

8. Duplex printing and output path
- Duplex assembly would turn the page to feed it again, otherwise the paper would go out using the exit rollers
- Manual duplex can be enables for person to manually turn the page. Printer pauses for this.

### Color laser printers
- They use separate toner catridges for the CMYK colors
- Some do separate runs for placing each color, others printing one pass with a transfer belt

## Laser Printer Maintenance
- They require constant maintenance and cleaning (dirt, paper dust and ink)

### Loading paper
- Use good quality paper and one that is adequate to your printing output (document or photo)
- Position media guides at the edge of paper stack. Do not overload or add unsupported paper.
- Do not use creased, dirty, or damp paper. Store it in a climate control place with no excess heat, temparature or dust.

### Replacing Toner Catridge

- Drum in toner catridge is light sensitive, fir catridge in print device immediately
- Toner Catridges are Waste From Electronic Equipment (WEEE) => Follow local reglations to discard

### Cleaning Printer
- Damp cloth to clean the exterior of dust
- Dust and toner from interior with soft cloth or toner-safe vacuum (Don't use compressed air, domestic vacuum cleaner)
- Wash toner of body with cold water
- Use alcohol with lint-free swaps to clean electronic components
- Replace printer's dust and ozone filters regulary using manufacturers recommendations

### Replacing the maintenance kit
- Laser printers need replacement of components in a scheduled fashin, with a replacement kit.
- Replace old fusers and rollers and clean the printer
- Use recycling program for old fusers and rollers.

### Calibrating printer
- Calibrating print density and color
- If print doesn't come out as expected, use calibration routine from printer's control panel or its software driver
