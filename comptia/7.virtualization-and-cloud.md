# Virtualization and Cloud Concepts

Virtualization => Running multiple OS on a single hardware allows
    - Testing and training
    - Cloud computing

# Client-side virtualization

Virtualziation allows multiple insulated software environments

## Hypervisors

A software that allows to run multiple Operating Systems on the same hardware
- OS installed on hypervisor is called Virtual Machine (VM) or guest OS
- It mediates the access to hardware resources to avoid conflicts with Host OS
- VMs need drivers for the emulated hardware components

Two ways of implementing Hypervisors

### Type 2 Hypervisors
- Hypervisor is installed on a Host OS
- Examples are VMWare and Virtual Box (Oracle), Workstation (Parallels) 

### Type 1 Hypervisors
- Hypervisor is installed directly on the hardware and doesn't go through a host OS
- A Virtual Machine Manages manages all operating systems as Guest OS
- Examples: ESXi (VMWare), Hyper-V (Microsoft), XEN (Citrix)

## Uses of Virtualization
Mainly used for Testing and development
- Sandbox: OS to test worms, viruses, Trojans. Malware contained in gues OS can't affect rest of computer.
- Support legacy software applications and OSs => Install Old OS as a VM
- Cross platform virtualization => Test Software under different OSs
- Training => LAB environments

### Server-Side Virtualization
- Deploying server as VM
- Usefull to use hardware more fully (several virtual servers on one hardware server for example)

### Application Virtualization
- So that clients can access latest version of application
- Most use Citrix XENApp

### Container Virtualization
- No hypervisor, enforces resource separation at OS level
- Cannot run Guest OS of different types (Running Windows on Linux Host for example)
- Docker => Server -> Host OS -> Docker Engine -> Binaries and libraries (shared or separate) -> Apps and instances
