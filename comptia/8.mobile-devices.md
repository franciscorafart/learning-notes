# Mobile Devices and Peripherals
Laptops, smartphones, tablets.

## Mobile display types
Mobile devices have a form factor that integrates system components and peripherals.

### Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)
- Liquid Crystal compound that changes properties with voltage
- Pixels are 3-RGB subpixels
- In modern computer and mobile devices displays Thin-Film Transitors (TFT) is used

Three types of TFT
1. Twisted Nematic (TN)
- Cyrstals twist or untwist based on voltage
- Fast response times
- Earliest type of TFT tech

2. In Plane-Switching (IPS)
- Rotating crystals
- Better color and angle range
- Early and cheaper ISP slightly worse response time

3. Vertical Alignment (VA)
- Crystals tilt
- Illumination by LEDs
- Used by smartphones

Important:
- Refresh rates and response times are important features to evaluate an LCD display

Older laptops used Cold Cathode Bulbs (CCFL) for screen light, which use AC current, so a converter was necessary to transform the DC current provided by the motherboard.

### Organic LED Displays (OLED)
- Each pixel by a separate LED => Doesn't require separate backlight
- Thinner, lighter, less power, and better contrast ratios
- Can be made of plastic, no glass needed => Flexible
- Less Maximum brightness than regular LCD
- More susceptible to burn-in => Retaining image after a static image for many hours

## Mobile Display Components
The display layer is only one layer on a mobile device's screen

### Digitizer functions (Touch screen)
- Placed between protective glass and display
- Grid of sensors
- capacitive digitizers => support multitouch and gestures
- Screen covered by scratch resistant glass and, optionally, an extra protection layer
- Avoid bubbling with the screen protector to avoid issues with the digitizer

### Rotating and removable screens
- Accelerometers and gyroscopes can track the orientation of the device
- Some laptops with touch screens have dettachable keyboards

## Mobile Device accesories

- Touchpads: EMebedded panel on laptop for pointer control
- Trackpads: Sometimes same as touchpad, but also as a peripheral device
- drawing pads: Large-format touch device for sketching in digital art.

## Touch pens
- They can be device specific digitizers

## Microphone, speaker, camera
- Integrated to mobile device
- Also external headsets
- Webcam: Can LED to illuminate the subject

## Wireless accestories
They can connect via:
- Bluetooth
- NFC (Near Field Communication)
- IR (Infrared)

# Configure Laptop hardware
Fixng and upgrading laptops is harder, but still possible, as they have some upgradable components.

## LAptop Disassembly Process

### HAnd tools
- Screws usually smaller and much easier to strip
- Label screws and position/orientation of cables => Take pctures if necessary

### Form Factors and plastic frames
- Get manufacturers documentation before begining an upgrade or replacement process => Only do this if there's no warranty

## Battery Replacement

- Laptops use an externeal AC adapter to conver wall current to DC. Normally they're auto-switching 110-220 V / 50/60Hz
- Fixed 110 to 220 V current will damage the adapter (Not the other way round)
- AC adapters rated on their power output.

### Battery power
- Removable rechargabke Lithium ion (Li-ion) battery parts (6, 9 or 12 cells)
- Disconnect from AC outlet and turn off machine before inserting or removing battery
- Laptop should come with power management driver to prevent repeated trickle charging from damaging it
- Life is affected by being at 0% or constantly at 100% charge
- Li-on batteries are sensitive to heat
- If storing, charge it to 40% and store it below 20C
- Typically they last aroung 2-3 years

### RAM and Adapter replacement
- Laptop RAM is packaged in a Small Outline DIMM (SODIMM) form factor.
- A SODIMM slot only accepts a specific kind of DDR (Ex. DDR3, DDR4)
- Keyed slots to prevent incompatible modules being installed
- Slot pops-up at 45 degrees.
- Also Mini-DIMM and Micro-DIMM form factors for ultra-portable devices.

### Upgrading adapter cards
- Modem adapters, wireless cards, SSD storage are usually replaceable via screw-down panels (Mini PCIe, M.2, mSATA)
- When changing wireless adapters the antennas for radio communications need to be reinstalled
- You can add GSM adapters too that require a SIM.

## Disk Upgrade and Replacement

- Laptops only support one storage disk. To change it you must have a migration plan.
- Migration: Using software to create an Image of the drive and store it in a USB drive. You can then restore the system.
- New Drive must me equal or larger than the old drive to be able to clone it.
- Replacement: Only data is backed up from the old drive.

- Laptop HDD are usually 2.5in form factor and 9,5mm height, or 1.8in. Magnetic 2.5 HHD tend to be slower compared to 3.5 in from desktops.
- HDD tend to be slower and have less capacity.
- Ultraportable laptop could require 7mm (thin) or 5mm (ultra thin) drive

## Keyboard and Security Component Replacement
- It can be cheaper to replace components than get a new laptop

### Keybiard and trackpad
- YOu will need to find the exact one that fits
- It could require completely disassembling the chasis
- Connects to motherboard via flat ribbon cable (usually) secured by a latch
- Use OS/driver setting utility or app to configure it

### Key replacement
- Replace carefully

### Biometric security component
- Fingerprint reader attached to the by ribbon cable like the keyboard

### Near field Scanner
- To pair peripheral devices or connect to smartphones
- NFC sensor must be connected to an antenna

# Troubleshoot mobile devices

## Power and battery issues
- Battery damage => Danger. If it gets punctured it can catch on fire. Face coverings and sand buckets.
- Power management options in device

If laptop doesn't turn on:
- Check battery correctly snaped
- Make sure contacts aren't dirty or blocked => Use swabs
- Poor health battery will not hold a charge

Other considerations;
- Keep cooling vents clear to avoid overheating
- Used compressed air to clear debris and dust from components

## Improper charging symptoms
 - Use manufacturer charger or approved replacement, DC jack, and cable integrity  => Wrong charger or exposing battery to heat can lead to explosion
 - A Li-on Battery shouldn't reach 0% or be permanently at 100% as it reduces battery life

## Swollen battery symptom
- If battery swells, stop using the mobile device (wobbles, or deformed touchpad/keyboard)
- Swollen battery is a problem with charging circuit, that prevents over charge
- Fire hazard and chemicals
- Contact manifacturer for disposal instructions

## Hardware failure issues

### Overheating Symptoms
- Vents blockedby putting device on soft surface, lap. Use laptop coolers if needed.
- Dust in vents
- High screen brightness and flashlight can rapidly heat hand-held devices
- Direct sunlight
- Devices have emergency shutdown for when it reaches limit temperatures

### Liquid Damage Symptoms
- Ingress Protection scale (IP) rates the water protection of a device => IP67 (6 repelling solids, 7 repelling liquids)
- Liquid damage might be visible on the screen
- Drain and fully dissasemble device for drying and clean contacts. Battery should be replaced.

### Physically damaged port symptoms
- Improper insertion of cables can damage ports => INtermittend connection or failure to charge

## Screen and calibration issues

If screen doesn't display try to insulate the issue: Graphics card, LED backlight, fluorecent light (old laptops). Make sure hinges switches are not stuck.

### Broken screen
- Broken screens on mobile phones are usually replaced by manufacturer
- Digitizer can be damaged by water without visible symptoms

### Digitizer issues
- Fingers and screen must be clean and dry
- No bubbles on screen protector
- Check that it's not a software issue (restart device)
- Test another location in case of electromagnetic interference
- See if wires were correctly installed after repair. Ask "What has changed?"
- If possible, uninstall and reinstall touchscreen drivers

### Cursor / drift calibration
- Make sure cursor is not too or too little sensitive
- Cursor issues could be due to many apps running

### Connectivity issues (wirelles bluetooth or cellular connection)

Similar to PC wireless connectivity, problems can be hardware or software.

Troubleshooting:
- Make sure adapter enabled
- Check antenna connection if laptop recently serviced
- Check battery of external bluetooth device
- Drivers of network device if problems with coming back from hybernation
- Make sure wireless adapter is not switched off by accident
- Make sure Airplane mode is not enabled


Intermitent connectivity
- Move devices closer together
- Change position of device (depending on the device, some work better in certain positions due to the antenna placement)
- Use WiFI analyzer
- GSM Signal Monitor or Cell Tower Analyzer for cellular radio signals

## Malware issues

- MAlware apps collect data on the background. They can become unresponsive or not shut own when closed.
- Data transmission capacity is a common symptom of malware present => Set limit triggers to monitor the data usage
- Malware can use camera or mic. Check that camera LED is not active.
