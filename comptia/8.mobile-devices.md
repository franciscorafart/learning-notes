# Mobile Devices and Peripherals
Laptops, smartphones, tablets.

## Mobile display types
Mobile devices have a form factor that integrates system components and peripherals.

### Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)
- Liquid Crystal compound that changes properties with voltage
- Pixels are 3-RGB subpixels
- In modern computer and mobile devices displays Thin-Film Transitors (TFT) is used

Three types of TFT
1. Twisted Nematic (TN)
- Cyrstals twist or untwist based on voltage
- Fast response times
- Earliest type of TFT tech

2. In Plane-Switching (IPS)
- Rotating crystals
- Better color and angle range
- Early and cheaper ISP slightly worse response time

3. Vertical Alignment (VA)
- Crystals tilt
- Illumination by LEDs
- Used by smartphones

Important:
- Refresh rates and response times are important features to evaluate an LCD display

Older laptops used Cold Cathode Bulbs (CCFL) for screen light, which use AC current, so a converter was necessary to transform the DC current provided by the motherboard.

### Organic LED Displays (OLED)
- Each pixel by a separate LED => Doesn't require separate backlight
- Thinner, lighter, less power, and better contrast ratios
- Can be made of plastic, no glass needed => Flexible
- Less Maximum brightness than regular LCD
- More susceptible to burn-in => Retaining image after a static image for many hours

## Mobile Display Components
The display layer is only one layer on a mobile device's screen

### Digitizer functions (Touch screen)
- Placed between protective glass and display
- Grid of sensors
- capacitive digitizers => support multitouch and gestures
- Screen covered by scratch resistant glass and, optionally, an extra protection layer
- Avoid bubbling with the screen protector to avoid issues with the digitizer

### Rotating and removable screens
- Accelerometers and gyroscopes can track the orientation of the device
- Some laptops with touch screens have dettachable keyboards

## Mobile Device accesories

- Touchpads: EMebedded panel on laptop for pointer control
- Trackpads: Sometimes same as touchpad, but also as a peripheral device
- drawing pads: Large-format touch device for sketching in digital art.

## Touch pens
- They can be device specific digitizers

## Microphone, speaker, camera
- Integrated to mobile device
- Also external headsets
- Webcam: Can LED to illuminate the subject

## Wireless accestories
They can connect via:
- Bluetooth
- NFC (Near Field Communication)
- IR (Infrared)

## WiFi-Networking

- All mobiel devices support a wifi radio network
- You can enable/disable wifi as well as cellular data network
- AAirplane mode disables all or most of he radio wireless features (cellular data, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, NFC)
- WiFi and cellular network antennas are wrapped around the device and connected to the adapter with internal wiring

## Cellular Data Networking

- Connecting to the internet over the carriers cellular network
- Data depends on support fo device and cell tower
- Charges on amount of data transfered. International Roaming particulary expensive.

## GSM vs CDMA

- GSM allows the use of a SIM card to use unlocked handset. Adopted globally and by At&T and T-mobile in the US.
- CDMA means handset is directly managed by the provider, no SIM. Limited to Verizon and Sprint.
- With CDMA a Preferred Roaming List (PRL) provides the information for the device to connect to the cellular network
- LTE => All 4G and 5G connections require a SIM card

### Cellular Network Data indicators
Icon on the status bar shos which type of connections is established

- G, E (GSM) or 1x (CDMA) represent minimal 2G connections (50-400kbps)
- 3G (UMTS in GSM / EV-DO CDMA). Upto 3MBps
- H/H+ => High Speed Packet Access, up to 42Mbps, likely lower.
- 4G/4G+ => LTE-Advanced. 20-90Mbps usually, up to 300Mbps
- 5G - Supposedly p to 1GBps, reallistically between 50Mbps-300Mbps

### Enable and disable cellular data
- Besides enable/disable, there's more fine grained configurations like caps and allowing/disallowing cetrain apps to use.

### Mobile Hotspots and Tethering
- Mobile devices can be configured as mobile hotspots to provide internet ot other devices
- Tethering is connecting other device to the interned via bluetooth or USB

## Mobile device wired connection
Mobile devices/ Laptops support wired connections
- Laptop ports: HDMI, DP, USB, USB-C, RJ-45
- Android: USB-C, Micro-B USB, Mini-B, 

### Serial interfaces
- Not a lot of mobile devices have hardware serial ports
- Serial Port often used for programming and to connect pother type of devices
-  Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)
    - On Android over USB or Bluetooth
    - iOS doesn't allow serial connections through lightning port, except for developer programs

## Bluetooth Wireless connections
Wireless accessory connection better than wires on mobile devices.

- Bluetooth needs to be enabled
- Both accesory and device must be put on "Discovery Mode" to establish connection
- Pairing should generate pin or access code automatically to accept the connection
- Test bluetooth connection by connecting to a device (music for example), or sending a file.
- Check that both are discoverable if connection can't be established

## Near Field Communication wireless connection
- Some mobile devices have NFC chips built-in
- 20cm / 8in data transmission
- Allows for payments in contactless point-of-sale (PoS) machines
- Device doesn't transmit Credit Card info on payment, but generates a one-time token that is validated when making a payment.
- Device has to be unlocked to start a transaction
- NFC also allows to establish bluetooth connections

## Port Replicators and Docking Stations

- Port replicators are connected to a laptop device to provide more connection ports (HUB)
- Docking station. Sophisticated port replicator that supports add-in cards. When docked laptop can function as a desktop machine. Often used just for port replication.
- Smartpone/tablet docks: Connects device to peripherals (mouse, keyboard, monitor) to make it work like a laptop.

# Configure Mobile Device Apps

## Mobile Apps

### iOS apps
- Wall-gardened apps distributed over App store.
- Apps: free to use, in-app purchases, and paid
- Developed in XCode IDE and Sqift programming language.

### Android apps
- Available on Google Play and third-party sites
- Java-based IDE, Android studio available in Linux, Windows and Mac

### Permissions
- Apps run in a sandbox and only have permissions given by the user
- Permissions can be revoked later

## Account Setup
- Mobile devices designed for one user (Apple Id or Google account)
- Devices can be syncronized via vendor cloud solutions
    - Microsoft 365
    - Google Cloud
    - iCloud
- Sub-accounts can be set up for services not linked to central account. Each app can have sub account.

## Types of Data to Synchronize
- Sync is copying data back and forth between devices 
    - Contacts (vCard)
    - Calendar => iCalendar format allows to share calendar data between services
    - Mail
    - Photo, Video => , main issuie with sync is they use a lot of space, different formats, version history
    - Apps
    - Passwords => Password saved to devices can be syncronized with cloud services (Security risk)

## Email Configuration options

### Commercial Provider email configuration
- OS can auto-Discover connection settings
- Autoiscover: Sepcial DNS records that specify how an account should be configured
- Enable autodiscover and enter email and credentials

### ISP and Corporate email config
- User/email, password, host address, and TLS option have to be added to configure Microsoft Exchange email
- If Autoiscover not available:
    - FDQN or IP address of IMAP or PoP3 server (Choose IMAP if accessing the email from different devices)
    - Set outgoing SMTP server
    - Enable / Disable TLS (If email provider supports it)
    - Default or email provider custom ports

## Synchronization methods
- Devices are these days backed up automatically on the cloud if given permission
- Establish data caps when synchronizing large amounts of data
- Limit sync over cellular network to avoid big charges

### Sync to PC
You cn sync Android to a Windows PC over a USB cable or bluetooth

### Sync to cars
- Cars come with built-in navigation and entertainment
- A mobile device can drive the "Head" of the unit and control navigation and media playback (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto)

## Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)
Software to apply security policies to the use of mobile devices and apps in an enterprise
Two main functions:
1. Mobile Device Management (MDM): Policies for auth, feature use and connectivity
2. Mobile Application Management (MAM): policies for apps to process corporate data.

Examples:
VMWare's Workspace One, Microsoft's Endpoint Manager, Citrix's Ednpoint Management, Apple's Business Manager

- Device enrolled in MAM software can only run approved corporate apps
- Storage of personal vs corporate data can be kept separate
- Blocks forwarding of corporate data and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

## Two-Factor Authentication
- When enrolled with enterprise management app, user could have to reauthenticate to access corporate workspace because of policies
- Two-factor authentication => User submits two different credentials to authenticate (Ex. Fingerprint and Pin)
    - Authenticator app, trusted email, registered phone number.

## Location Services
Location service of a device uses two systems:
1. GPS. Satellite positioning. Not all mobile devices have it.
2. IPS - Indoor Positioning System: Triangulation based on distance from radio sources such as cellular twoers, WiFI APs, Bluetooth/RFID beacons.

- Only available to apps for which user has granted explicit access.
- Some mobile devices has Magnetometer, that can determine the direction of the device
