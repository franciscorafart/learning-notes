# Mobile Devices and Peripherals
Laptops, smartphones, tablets.

## Mobile display types
Mobile devices have a form factor that integrates system components and peripherals.

### Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)
- Liquid Crystal compound that changes properties with voltage
- Pixels are 3-RGB subpixels
- In modern computer and mobile devices displays Thin-Film Transitors (TFT) is used

Three types of TFT
1. Twisted Nematic (TN)
- Cyrstals twist or untwist based on voltage
- Fast response times
- Earliest type of TFT tech

2. In Plane-Switching (IPS)
- Rotating crystals
- Better color and angle range
- Early and cheaper ISP slightly worse response time

3. Vertical Alignment (VA)
- Crystals tilt
- Illumination by LEDs
- Used by smartphones

Important:
- Refresh rates and response times are important features to evaluate an LCD display

Older laptops used Cold Cathode Bulbs (CCFL) for screen light, which use AC current, so a converter was necessary to transform the DC current provided by the motherboard.

### Organic LED Displays (OLED)
- Each pixel by a separate LED => Doesn't require separate backlight
- Thinner, lighter, less power, and better contrast ratios
- Can be made of plastic, no glass needed => Flexible
- Less Maximum brightness than regular LCD
- More susceptible to burn-in => Retaining image after a static image for many hours

## Mobile Display Components
The display layer is only one layer on a mobile device's screen

### Digitizer functions (Touch screen)
- Placed between protective glass and display
- Grid of sensors
- capacitive digitizers => support multitouch and gestures
- Screen covered by scratch resistant glass and, optionally, an extra protection layer
- Avoid bubbling with the screen protector to avoid issues with the digitizer

### Rotating and removable screens
- Accelerometers and gyroscopes can track the orientation of the device
- Some laptops with touch screens have dettachable keyboards

## Mobile Device accesories

- Touchpads: EMebedded panel on laptop for pointer control
- Trackpads: Sometimes same as touchpad, but also as a peripheral device
- drawing pads: Large-format touch device for sketching in digital art.

## Touch pens
- They can be device specific digitizers

## Microphone, speaker, camera
- Integrated to mobile device
- Also external headsets
- Webcam: Can LED to illuminate the subject

## Wireless accestories
They can connect via:
- Bluetooth
- NFC (Near Field Communication)
- IR (Infrared)
