# Managing Windows Networks

## Windows Network Connection Types
- PC connects to networ trhough Network Adapter (or NIC) to switch or wireless AP

### Wired Connections
- Most based on Ethernet with RJ45 or Fiber Optic cabling.
- Adapter and switch must have same settings -> Usually set to autonegotiate link
- In Windows adapters get a name assigned: Ethernet, Ethernet2...
- To adapt settings manually: `Device Maager -> Properties -> Advanced (tab)` or `Network & Internet`

### Wireless connection
- Network status icon on notification area -> Select from list and enter required credentials
- Connect Automatically option possible
- If SSID suppresed /hidden, WLAN settings must be set manually: `Network & Internet -> Wi-Fi -> Manage known networks -> Add a new Network`
- Wifi properties of adapter on `Device Manager`. Most card support any standard available (802.11n, 802.11g, 802.b)

## IP addressing schemes
- To connect to network, logical adapter must have valid client network configuration: Adapter configured with client software and appropiate IP address allocated

### Internet Protocol addressing scheme
Ipv4. 32-bit address with 32-bit subnet mask.
Ipv6: 128-bit address. Interface address is last 64-bits. Network prefixes identify logical networks on first 64 bits.

- default gateway: IP address of the local router. Usually assigned first value available.
- Host also configured with DNS servers. DNS usually condifured on the Router in a home setting (Same values in host and router)
-  A Host can have a domain suffix to identify FQDN on the local network.

### Static vs Dynamic COnfiguration
IPs can be assigned statically or dinamically. Most hosts are configured to get IP address automatically with a DHCP server.

## Windows Client Configuration
Ip config of each network adapter on GUI via `Network & Internet` settings or `Network Connections` applet (ncpa.cpl). Default installed protocols on NEtwork Adapter:
- Client for Microsoft Networks
- File and Print sharing for Microsoft Networks
- Internet Protocol: Both IPv4 and IPv6 will be installed, adapter uses appropiate one depending on network it connects to
- Link-Layer Topology Discovery: Mapping and discovery for networks without dedicated name servers

- Default to DHCP for obtaining IP addresses
- Ip Configurations can be set via Settings App too, `Edit IP settings`

## Network Location

- Network connections governed by local OS Firewall settings by Windows Defender firewall.
- NLA - Network Location Awareness service prompts to set network type when connecting to one

Private network type:
- Trusted network (Home or office)
- PC is discoverable for print or file sharing

Public network:
- Firewall will block all traffic
- PC will be hidden from other devices
- Can't be used for file and print sharing

`Network & Internet` => Modify network type
- If Network discovery enabled: other PCs can be accessed via Network Object in File Explorer.
- UNC (Universal Naming Convention) standard to address network and host resources. Network path syntax: `\\ Host\Path` . Host is IP or FQDN and Path is shared folder's file path.

## Windows Defender Firewall Configuration

`Firewall & network protection` in Windows Defender Firewall applet.
- Block or allow incoming connections
- Configure exceptions in status page => Allow specific programs to go through Firewall

## VPN and WWAN Connection types

### VPN
- Enterprises need workers and services to connect remotely to their local networks
- VPN is an encrypted tunnel between two private networks, over a public network (WLAN)
- Remote PC becomes part of the local network, only limited to WAN link bandwidth
- `Network & Internet` to configure VPN. Some might require use of third-party software

### WWAN
Wireless Wide Area Network connection: Use cellular adapter to connect to internet via provider's network
- Bandwidth depends on adapter's and local cell tower supported techology (3G, 4G, 5G)
- WWAN adapter can be a USB or internal (Needs a SIM for GSM adapters) -> Enable connection on network status icon
- Cellular networks can charge for exceeding => Set network as `metered` and set data limit in Settings

## Proxy Settings
- Forwards packages from another service
- Can improve performance through caching
- Can improve security
- `Network & Internet` Settings to configure proxy settings

# Troubleshoot Windows Networking

## Troubleshoot IP configuration

Error states local network adater (Given not disconnected):
- Limited connectivity: DHCP server can't be contacted => Device gets APIPA or use IP specified as an alternative in IPv4 properties
- No Internet Access: IP config valid for LAN and Windows can't identify working Internet connection => Problem with router, DNS or both 

- We can See internet configuration with `ipconfig` or in `Network & Internet` settings

### ipconfig command


# T SORO notes

# Commands
`tracert` => Show path internet traffic takes to get to end destination (Trace Route)
`ipconfig` / `ifconfig` =>
`ping`
`nslookup` => Ip address associated to a domain
`netstat` =. Report status and connections
`gpupdate` -> To force group policy update
