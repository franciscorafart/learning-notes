# Configuring SOHO security

# Attacks, Threats, Vulnerabilities

## Information Security

1. Information Security - Secure information triad CIA
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

2. Cybersecurity => Controls to protect attacks on computer storage and processing systems

Hardening system: Making it more secure, adding policies and controls.

3 components of assestment of networks:
1. Vulnerabilities => weaknes that can be intentionally or accidentally triggers
2. Threats => Potential for an actor to exploit a vulnerability, intentionally or accidentally.
   ` Theat actor`: Who poses the threat
3. Risks: Likelihood and impact (consequence) of a vulnerability being exploted by a Threat Actor.

Important:
Vulnerability + Threat = Risk (Impact * likelihood)

## Vulnerabilities
Causes: Misconfigurations software and hardware, delays on patching, untested software/firmaware, poorly designed architecture, inadequate physical security, bad passwords, unchecked user input, etc.

### Non-Compliant Systems
- Configuration baseline: Recommendations for deploying computer in hardened configuration
- Baselines are different for different systems, OS, and clients
- Purpose of configuration baseline => Reduce attack surface
- Non-compliant System: A system that drifted from its baseline configuration

### Unprotected System
- Example baseline recommendations: Antivirus scanners, firewalls, intrusion detection systems.
- Unprotected system: System where at least one of this elements is missing or misconfigured => Increases attack surface

### Software and Zero-day vulnerabilities
- Software vulnerrability => flaw in design or code that allows security circumvention or app crashing
- Exploits: Most serious vulnerabilities. Allows attacker to execute code on host, that can install mallware
- Zero-day: Vulnerability that is exploted before the developer knows about it and can release a patch

### Unpatched and EOL OSs
- Zero-day very destructive but not common
- Greater threat is unpatched legacy systems
- Not only PCs, but any device running on a network can be hacked

### BYOD Vulnerability
- In BYOD it's hard for security team to define secure baseline configurations for multiple devices
- BYOD increases Attack Surface

## Social Engineering

- Social Engineering: Hacking the human => Persuading or intimidating individual to reveal critical information

Common formes of Social Engineering:
1. Impersonation: By pretexting (direct communication), telling a lie or half-truth, a Threat Actor can get trust from an employee and give information

2. Dumpster Diving:
- Public information of an employee or organization can make an impersonation attempt more credible.
- Dumpster Diving: Getting information from documents company has thrown away or discarded removable media

3. Shoulder surfing
- Learning a password or PIN by watching the user type it, or through binocuars, CCTV

4. Tailgating and Piggybacking

- Tailgating: Enter secure area without authorization by following person closely
- Piggybacking: Entering a secure area with an employees permission (I forgot my key)

## Phishing and Evil Twins
- Phishing: Making spoofed electronic communication seem authentic to victim. Asking to install a malware, giving remote access, spoof websites to capture login credentials.

### Phishing variants
- Spear phishing: When atacker has information that makes target more prone to fall.
- Whaling: Attack directed at upper levels of management (CEOs or big fish) who are usually reluctant to security procedures.
- Vishing: Phishing through Voice (telephone, VoIP)

### Evil Twin atack
- Use of rogue wireless access point to try harvesting credentials
- Similar network nae (SSID) to trusted one
- Redirect users to spoofed websites

## Threat types
- Static threats were common in the past: Viruses that can be easily identified with automated software
- Currently attackers can circumvent signature-based scanning => Threat complex and multi factor

### External vs Internal threats
- external threat: actor with no account or authorized access => Has to infiltrate using malware or social engineering
- Insider threat: Actor with system permissions (employee, business partner, contractor), malicious or non-malicious.

### Footprinting threats
- Information gathering were attacker tries to identify networks and security system configuration
- Public info, scan ports and websites, social engineering to discover vulnerabilities

### Sppofing threats
- Atack were threat actor can mask as a trusted user or PC.
- Ex. Cloning MAC or IP addresses, false digital certificate, email message that imitates original
- Spoofing also can be done to obtain logical or software authentication token
- Replay attack: Capturing token and presenting it to access platform

### On-path attacks (Man-in-the-middle attack)
- Spoofing were traffic is covertly intercepted between two hosts/networks => Read and modify packages

### Denial of Service (DoS)
- Making service unavailable for regular users
- Bombarding services with spoofed requests
- Physical DoS => Cutting cable or turning computer off
- Often used to mask different kind of attack => Distract security team to go after another goal

### Distributed denial of Service (DDoS)
- DoS attack launched from multiple compromised systems or `botnet`
- To establish botnet threat actor must first compromise +1 machine to use Command and Control (C&C)
- C&C machine is used to compromise many other devices by installing bots automatically
- Bot establishes persisten remote-control channel with C&C host => Attack using all devices in the botnet

## Password attacks
- Many attacks occur because threat actor gets credentials to access network
- When actors gain access they attempt to escalate privileges
- A plaintext password can be obtained with password file or sniffing unencrypted traffic.
- Password usually transmited with a cryptographic hash of string entered by user
- Hacker can get file with password hashes in local system: `%SystemRoot%\System32\config\SAM`, `%SystemRoot%\NTDS\NTDS.DIT` and `/etc/shadow`

- PAssword cracking software can be used to identify password from the cryptographic hash
1. Dictionary
Hash is compared to hashes of common passwords or information related to the user

2. Brute force
A password can be brute forced in minutes if not a good one

## Cross Site scripting attacks

- Most web applications rely on user input
- Fail to validate input: common web app vulnerability
- Threat actor could be able to send a script through an input field => Input validation vulnerability

- XSS - Cross Site scripting => Browser trusts scripts that come from site user is visiting.
Steps:
1. Attacker identifies Input vulnerability on site
2. Attacker crafts a URL to perform code injection
3. User opens link trusted site returns page that contains malicious code that will be executed by Browser
4. Code steals users cookies, intercepts data put into a form, or installs malware.

- XSS attack is non-persistent => At no point data in server changed

## SQL injection attack
 - Adding SQL code to an unsanitized input field
 - Attacker could extract, create, or delete information.
 Ex: User inputs name as "Bob"
 `SELECT * from tbl_user WHERE username = 'Bob'`

 But putting `' or 1=1--` on the input:

SELECT * from tbl_user WHERE username = '' or 1=1--#

- 1-1 always true and `--#` turns rest of statement into comment.
- This would dump a list of all users

## Hashing and Encryption concepts
Three types of cryptographic technology
1. Cryptographic hashes
- Turns any input into a fixed-length string output.
- One-way input => Can't recover original data from hash
- Used for secure storage of data were original content doesn't have to be recovered (passwords)
- SHA and MD5 are popular algorithms. MD5 gradually being phased out.

2. Symmetric encryption
- Single key to encrypt and decrypt data
- If key is stolen security is breached => Main problem
- Advantage: Speed . AES can encrypt multiple streams of data efficiently

3. Assymetric encryption
- Key pair, mathematically linked public and private key
- What one key encrypts, the other decrypts
- Private key is kept secret (user or PC)
- Public key is open for anyone to use => Private key cannot be derived from public key
- Drawback: message can't be larger than the key size

## Digital Signatures and Key exchange

- Different uses of Encryption and hashes
- For large file assymetric encryption splits file into many pieces
-A combination of symmetric and assymetric encryption and hashes is udes to develop some products

### Digital signatures
- Proves a message or digital certificate has not been spoofed
- Sender computes a cryptographic hash, encrypts it with his private key, and attaches the result as a digital signature
- Receiver decrypts with public key to obtain senders hash. Then computes its own hash and compares it

### Key exchange
- Allows two hosts to share same symmetric encryption key without any other host knowing what it is
- Symmetric cypher faster => Protect data exchange on a session
- Assymetric encryption used to share the symmetric key, as it works better on smaller texts
- Sender uses public key to encrypt symmetric key
- Receiver uses private key to retreive symmetric key
- Receiver uses symmetric key to decrypt message sent by the sender
- Symmetric key is called `session key` and `ephemeral key` if it is changed often.

# Wireless Security Protocols

## Wifi Protected Access

Main problem: Sine unguided (no cable) anything within range can listen to the signals

WPA - Wifi Protected Access: Protocol to authenticate and encrypt Wifi traffic

### Temporal Key Integrity Protocol - TKIP

WPA
- Uses RC4 to encrypt traffic (Like WEP)
- Adds TKIP mechanism to try mitigating attacks against WEP (flawed web standard)

### WPA 2
- WPA was still vulnerable to `replay attack` that try to recover encryption key
- WPA2 uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- AES is deployed within CCMP - Counter Mode With Cypher Block Changing Message Authentication Code Protocol
- CCMP replaces TKIP
- CCMP provides authenticated encryption, which make replay attacks harder
- Better to select WPA2-AES

### WPA3
- Weaknesses also in WPA2
- SAE - Simultaneous Authentication of Equals
    - WPA2 uses four-way handshake for exchange of encryption key between AP and device that can be vulnerable
    - WPA3 replaces 4-way handshake with SAE Mechanism
- Updated Cryptographic protocols
    - WPA3 replaces AES CCMP with stronger AWS Galois Counter Mode Protocol (GCMP)
- Protected Management frames
    - WPA3 mandates use of encryption for management frames.
- WiFi Enhanced Open
    - Open Wifi has no passphrase. In WPA2 all traffic is unencrypted
    - WPA3 encrypts this traffic too
    - Any station can join network but traffic is protected against sniffing

## Wifi Authentication methods
Three types of WiFi authentication
- Personal: WPA2-PSK or WPA3-SAE
- Open
- Enterprise

### WPA2 Pre-shared key authentication (PSK)

- PSK uses a passphrase to generate key used to encrypt communications
- Group authentication because group of users shared the same passphrase
- Passphrase 8-63 characters configured by administrator => Converted tom hash called Pairwise Master Key (PMK)
- PMK used in 4-way handshake to derive various session keys
- All PSK auth vulnerable to attacks vulnerable to recover the pass phrase (At least 14 characters long to mitigate danger)

### WPA3 Personal Authentication

- Still uses passphrase group-based authentication
- Improvements to general Wifi encryption thanks to SAE (Simultaneous athentication of equals) replacing PSK
- Personalized encryption => Users on a WPA3 personal network can't spoof on another's WPA3's personal traffic

## Enterprise Authentication Protocols
Problem personal authentication:
1. Passphrase shared => Fails to provide accounting
2. Passphrase many times weak

802.13X => Enterprise authentication
- Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
- Uses EAP over Wireless (EAPoW) => AP forwards authentication data without allowing any other type of network access

Workflow:
1. Supplicant requests association => AP enables channel for EAPoW traffic only
2. Passes credentials from suplicant to AAA server on wired network validation
3. After authenticated, AAA server sends Maste Key (MK) to wireless PC or laptop
4. AAA server transmits PMK to AP. Wireless station use PMK to derive session keys with WPA2 4-way handshake or WPA3 SAE method

- AP doesn't need to store any user account's or credentials. stored on the AAA server.
- EAP supports more advances authentication methods than usernames an passwords
- EAP use a digital certificate on server or client machines => Smart card authentication without password / MFA

- EAP with Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) strongestypes of multifactor authentication
1. Server and wireless supplicant issues with encryption key pair and digital certificate
2. Wireless device => Private key stored in TPM or USB => User authenticates with Pin or biometric (First factor)
3. When device associates to network, server sends digital signature handshake and certificates
4. Supplicant validates signature and certificate, and sends own handshake and certificate (2nd Factor)
5. Server checks supplican'ts handshake  and certificates and authenticates

## RADIUS, TACACS+, KERBEROS

Protocols to implement AAA server and network directory

1. RADIUS
- AP configures as client of RADIUS server
- AP forwards data between RADIUS server and supplicant, instead of authenticating directly
- AP configured with IP address of RADIUS and shared secret (allows to trust each other)
- Used usually to auth connections by wireless and VPN users 

2. TACACS+

- Implemented by CISCO
- Used to auth administrative access to routers, switches, and AP

3. Kerberos
- On Windows Kerberos allows users to authenticate to a Domain Contoller (DC)
- Facilitates SSO
- Issues authorization tickets that give user accounts rights and permissions on compatible application servers
- No APs with direct support for Kerberos. APs use RADIUS or TACACS+ and EAP to tunnel creadentials and tokens

# Configure SOHO Router Security

## Video
- Change default password
- Check which LAN ports are enabled (To prevent people connecting by wire)
- User credentials vs Router credentials
- Remote support enabled can be security issue if somoene has Routers credentials => Can access it from anywhere
    - Can be useful for enterprises for people to fix router remotelys
- Firmware:
    Updating firmware on Router interrupts connection => Communicate with clients by other means

## Home Router Setup

Home Router => Single appliance that combines Internet Router, DSL/Cable modem, Switch, WIFI AP.

### Physical placement / secure location
- Ideally router should be placed on secure location, locked, to prevent physical access
- At home router must be placed near point of entry of service provider's cable.
- Home router can't be locked in a cabinet because it would decrease signal

### Home router setup
- Connect it to WAN wih RJ45 (Fiber or external digital Modem), RJ11 (DSL), Coax (Cable)
- Connect PC to router and make sure PC set to DHCP tom get IP automatically
- Open device manageent's URL, usually http://192.168.0.1
- Change default password after log in (+12 characters) and user name

### Internet Access and Static Wide Area Network IP
- Usually Wizard to set up connection
- WAN link usually self-configuring
- ISP configures Router's public IPv4 address
- Some Internet packages offer static IP (paid or not), can be configured by DHCP reservation

## Firmware Update
- Keep firmware up to date => Patch security holes and support latest security standards (Ex. WPA3)
- Download firware from vendors website => Make sure correct model
- In Firmware upgrade select file. Keep device powered on during process.

## Home Router LAN and WLAN configuration

### Service Set ID (SSID)
- Simple case sensitive name by which users identify a WLAN
- Change the manufacturers default and not expose personal information in it
- On business env don't use meaninful names (Ex. Accounts) => Target for hackers
- You can disable the broadcast of an SSID. It can still be detected using packet sniffinf tools and Wifi Analyzers

### Encryption settings

- Encryption and security option alow you to set authentication mode => Set higher standard supoorted by device.
- Ideal: Select WPA3, enable WPA2 (AES/CCMP) compatibility if necessary
- Enter strong passphrase to generate network key (personal authentication)

### Disabling guest access
- Most routers enableguest access without credentials => Disable it if appropiate

### Changing channels
- Set auto-detect for radio freq bands (2.4GHz, 5 GHz 6GHz) => Router selects less congested channel.
- Use Wifi analyzer to see which channel is less congested on AP

## Home Router Firewall Configuration
- Home routers come with basic firewall. Two types of filtering:

Inbound filtering: Determines if remote hosts can connect to given TCP/UDP ports on internal hosts.
Outbound filtering: Determines hosts and sites internal hosts are permitted to connect to.


- Any packet-filtering firewall can allow/block traffic based on source/dest IP=> Determining which IPs to block complex
- Home routers implement `content filtering` => firewall downloads curated reputation databases. Ip addresses, FQDN and UR withk known content sites and malware, spam, and other threats.
- Filter can block URLs based on search terms, keywords, and phrases.
- Also restrict time in which internet is available

## Home Router Port Forwarding Configuration
- Port forwarding allows internet hosts to connect to computers on local network => Multiplayer games or web server

### Staic IP addresses and DHCP Reservations
- To do port forwarding identify destination PC by IP address
    - Configure static address
    - or create Reservation DHCP => DHCP server always assigns same IP address to host (enter MAC address of the computer)

### Configuring Port-Forwarding and Port Triggering rules
- Internet hosts only see WAN's IP address
- Port forwading: Process in which router forwards request for a particular application (specific port) to a designated host on a LAN
- Port Mapping: When external port is forwarded to different local port
- Port tigeering: To setup applications that require more than one port (Ex. FTP). When router detects outbound activity, it temporarily activates inbound port.

### Disable unused ports
- Hardended configuration => Only enable services that must be enabled
- Home router default block from internet host opening connection to local port => Exceptions are port-forwarding exceptions.
- Disable rules that are no longer required => Don't forget about it.

## Universal Plug and Play

- Services that require complex firewal configurations can use Universal Plug-n-play (UPnP) frameworek to send instructions to the firewall.
- Enable UPnP on the Firewall => ient UPnP (XBox, Playstation) will be able to configure Firewall autoatically to open IP addresses and ports necessary to play online game or receive VoIP calls.
- Security vulnerabilities => Better disable it if not required
    - Router should not receive UNnP configuration request from external interface (Internet)
    - Keep firmware up to date
    - Disable UPnP on client devices as well

## Screened Subnets (DMZ)
- Careful with port-forwarding. If server target is compromised, it can give access to the rest of the LAN.
- In enterprise network, creened subnet is means of establishing more secure configuration (DMZ)
- Screened Subnet => Host is placed in separate network segnment with different IP subnet address range thatn rest of LAN
- Uses two firewalls or one firewall that can route at least three interfaces.
- Different rules apply to communication between screened subnet-Internet, Lan-Internet, Lan-screened subnet

LAN => Choke Router / Firewal => Screened Subnet =>  Screening Router / Firewall => ISP Router

Home Router DMZ (different)
- Be Aware Home Routers vendors use the term DMZ, but it's not the same
- Refers to PC on LAN that can receive communications for any ports that have not been forwarded to other hosts
- It means "Not protected by the firewall", PC is fully accessible to other internet hosts.

# Summarize Security Measures

- Physical Security => Access to sites and buildings and network devices, documents and equipment.

## Physical access control

### Permiter security
- Bollards and Security posts: Prevent vehivles from crashing or exploding bombs near building
- Fences, barricades, lighting, surveillanec control.

### Access Control Vestibules
- People should enter and leave building through defined entries and exits
- Use of turnstile to avoid door holding
- Control vestibule: One gateway leads to enclosed space protected by another barrier => One person at a time.

### Magnetometers
- Metaldetector

### Guards

## Lock types
- Key operated
- Electronic: PIN or electronic keypad
- Badge Reader: hardware magnetic card, cryptographic contactless smart card (harder to clone)

### Biometric Door Locks
- Fingerprint reader
- Palprint scanner
- Retina Scanner: Infrared light to identify pattern of blood vessels => One of the most accurate.

### Equipment Locks
- Kensington locks => cable to secure a laptop or device to chair or pilar
- Chassis locks and faceplates => Prevent physical access to servers (external USB ports and internal disks)
- Lockable rack cabinets: For switches, servers, routers.

## Alarms and Surveillance

- Security of entry points that can be misused => Fit bars,locks, alarms

Alarm systems:
- Circuit: Triggers alarm when circuit is opened or closed. For windows, doors, fences.
- Motion Sensors: Microwave radio detection or Passive Infrared (PIR) => Moving heat sources
- Proximity: Radio freq ID (RFID) to track movement of tagged objects in an area
- Duress: Manual triggering of alarm. Wireless pendant, concealed sensor, call contact.

Video surveillance
- Second layer of security
- On permiter areas or security zones
- Older CCTV or IP cameras
- Can do motion detection and facial recognitions as well.

Lightning:
- Good for perception of safe building
- Deters intrusion
