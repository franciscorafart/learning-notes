# Configuring SOHO security

# Attacks, Threats, Vulnerabilities

## Information Security

1. Information Security - Secure information triad CIA
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

2. Cybersecurity => Controls to protect attacks on computer storage and processing systems

Hardening system: Making it more secure, adding policies and controls.

3 components of assestment of networks:
1. Vulnerabilities => weaknes that can be intentionally or accidentally triggers
2. Threats => Potential for an actor to exploit a vulnerability, intentionally or accidentally.
   ` Theat actor`: Who poses the threat
3. Risks: Likelihood and impact (consequence) of a vulnerability being exploted by a Threat Actor.

Important:
Vulnerability + Threat = Risk (Impact * likelihood)

## Vulnerabilities
Causes: Misconfigurations software and hardware, delays on patching, untested software/firmaware, poorly designed architecture, inadequate physical security, bad passwords, unchecked user input, etc.

### Non-Compliant Systems
- Configuration baseline: Recommendations for deploying computer in hardened configuration
- Baselines are different for different systems, OS, and clients
- Purpose of configuration baseline => Reduce attack surface
- Non-compliant System: A system that drifted from its baseline configuration

### Unprotected System
- Example baseline recommendations: Antivirus scanners, firewalls, intrusion detection systems.
- Unprotected system: System where at least one of this elements is missing or misconfigured => Increases attack surface

### Software and Zero-day vulnerabilities
- Software vulnerrability => flaw in design or code that allows security circumvention or app crashing
- Exploits: Most serious vulnerabilities. Allows attacker to execute code on host, that can install mallware
- Zero-day: Vulnerability that is exploted before the developer knows about it and can release a patch

### Unpatched and EOL OSs
- Zero-day very destructive but not common
- Greater threat is unpatched legacy systems
- Not only PCs, but any device running on a network can be hacked

### BYOD Vulnerability
- In BYOD it's hard for security team to define secure baseline configurations for multiple devices
- BYOD increases Attack Surface

## Social Engineering

- Social Engineering: Hacking the human => Persuading or intimidating individual to reveal critical information

Common formes of Social Engineering:
1. Impersonation: By pretexting (direct communication), telling a lie or half-truth, a Threat Actor can get trust from an employee and give information

2. Dumpster Diving:
- Public information of an employee or organization can make an impersonation attempt more credible.
- Dumpster Diving: Getting information from documents company has thrown away or discarded removable media

3. Shoulder surfing
- Learning a password or PIN by watching the user type it, or through binocuars, CCTV

4. Tailgating and Piggybacking

- Tailgating: Enter secure area without authorization by following person closely
- Piggybacking: Entering a secure area with an employees permission (I forgot my key)

## Phishing and Evil Twins
- Phishing: Making spoofed electronic communication seem authentic to victim. Asking to install a malware, giving remote access, spoof websites to capture login credentials.

### Phishing variants
- Spear phishing: When atacker has information that makes target more prone to fall.
- Whaling: Attack directed at upper levels of management (CEOs or big fish) who are usually reluctant to security procedures.
- Vishing: Phishing through Voice (telephone, VoIP)

### Evil Twin atack
- Use of rogue wireless access point to try harvesting credentials
- Similar network nae (SSID) to trusted one
- Redirect users to spoofed websites
