# Managing Security Settings

- Domain controllers send security requirements to workstations in Windows domain (For example: complex password)

## Password Best practices

- Password authentication has long history of vulnerabilities: inadequate tech and poor password practices
- Strong password important as not all companies switch to MFA

### Password rules
- Long password: +12 characters for user accounts, longer for administrative ones.
- Memorable phrase: Something you can remember, but no personal information => Anything that an attacker could find out should not be used

Common password policies
- Complexity requirements: Mix of character types 
- Password expiry: Passwords only valid for a certain period of time.

- These are sometimes deprecated as they incentivise bad practices like writting it down.

### BIOS/UEFI password
- System User password => Password before the OS can boot
    - Configured at BIOS or UEFI
    - Shared by all users so not commonly used
    - Extra security on standalone computer with no interactive logon

- System/Supervisor password
    - Potects access to firmware system-setup program
    - System user password requires System/Supervisor password

- Pre-boot authentication
    - Supported (maybe) by PCs with UEFI firmaware
    - System loads authentication application that contacts auth server and lets user submit credentials for an account

## End User Best practices
