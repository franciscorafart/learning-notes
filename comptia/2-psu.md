# Power Supply Units (PSU)

A PSU turns AC alternate current from the outlet to direct current (DC) voltage output. It steps down voltage, filters, and regulates to ensure consistent voltage output levels.

- Most PSU are designed for ATX form factor PCs
- They can be for only 110V (low inline), 220v (high inline) or Dual Voltage.

## Wattage rating
W = I * V (Power in Watts is equal to Voltage x Amperes or current intensity)
- A PSU should meet the combined power requirements of all the components (Addition of Watts required by components)
- Normal desktop PSU are units between 200-300
- Gaing PCs can require up to 500, specially to Graphics cards and CPUs

Power output PSU !== Power from grid taken by PSU. Example: a 75% efficient PSU with an output of 300W would draw 400W from the outlet.
### Rails
Power is supplied by a PSU through different voltage rails:
    - 3.3 VDC
    - +5 VDC
    - 12 VDC

    12VDC is the most commonly used rail.
