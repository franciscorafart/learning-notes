# Comparing local network hardware

## LAN (Local Area Network)

A Local Area Network (LAN) is group of computers connected by cabling at a single geographical location.

### 802.3 Ethernet standards
Standards maintained by the Institute of Electronic Engineers (IEEE) designated as 

`x Base Y`, where:
x: Nominal data rate
y: Cable Type 

100Base-T => Fast Ethernet over copper twisted cable. 100 Mbps
1000Base-T => Gigabit Ethernet over copper twisted cable. 1 Gbps, standard choice of LAN networks
10GBase-T => 10Gbps over copper cable

* Other types of Ethernet work over fiber optic cable.

## WLAN (Wireless LAN)
Radios and antennas for data transmission. Based on IEEE 802.11 standard (or WIFI)

Wi-fi and Ethernet technologies complement each other.

## WAN (Wide area Networks)

A Network of multiple geographical locations. The internet is a type of WAN.
An ISP facilitates access to access to the internet from local networks.

Some companes will have a WAN to connect to LANs of the same company.

## MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
Larger than a LAN, smaller than a WAN. restricted to a specific metropolitan area.

##  SOHO LAN
Small Office Home Office LAN is business-oriented network that gives access to both the internet and a LAN => SOHO router, internet router, boradband router.

In more complex business set ups different work areas (PCs, Server rooms, wireess devices) are connected to each other through Workgroup Switches. The workgroup switches connect the blocks to Core Distributions switches, routers, and firewalls.

## Datacenters and Storage Area Networks
Two roles of computers: Client and Server.
On Enterprise LAN servers are hosted on spearate area (Server room). If company needs a lot of servers these might be stored on a Data Center.
Most datacenters are stored in purpose-built facilities.

### DAS (Direct Attached Network)
 - Low cost, low maintenance data storage solution
 - Storage directly connected to servers through SCSI connections
 - Not for sharing data accross network
 - Not scalable
 - Suitable for small businesses that share data locally with little IT support

# NAS (Network Attached Storage)
- Dedicated storage shared through a network (Connected to a Switch)
- Allows local and remote access to data through network
- NAS is one node on a network
- Available 24/7
- Small and medium size businesses, reliable and scalable data storage

### SAN (Storage Area Network)
A Network that provisions access to storage devices that can be used by the servers. SAN is isolated from the main network (Client devices). SAN client's are servers running DBs or applications.

- Servers are connected with storage RAIDs
- Provisioning shared storage pool as a SAN is more flexible and reliable than local disks on each server machine. 
- Uses Fiber Channel and Internet SCSI (iSCSI) for connectivity.
- More complex and expensive than NAS (Network access storage)


# PAN (Personal Area Network)
Wireless connetivity of devices in proximity, laptops, mobile, printers, video display. Use of PAN is growing as use of IoT devices grows.

# Network Hardware

## Network Interface Card (NIC)
- Ethernet goes through twisted copper cable or fiber optic cable.
- Most NIC cards have a 1000Base-T compatible adapter.
- With NIC adapter it can support other Ethernet types, like fiber optic.
- NIC with multiple ports can bond together to create a faster speed.

### Media Access Control (MAC Address)
Each NIC has a unique hardware/physical address called the mac address.
- Each Ethernet frame identifies source and destination MAC address in its header.
- 49 binary digits, six bytes in size.
- Typically represented as 12 hexadecimal digits, separated by colon, hyphen or nothing.

## Patch pannels
- Computers are connected though the wall socket to a patch pannel. 
- Wall cables en up on a insulation displacement connector (IDC) on the back of th patch pannel.
- Front of the patch panel has pre-wired RJ45 cables.
- A patch cord is used to connect a port to an ethernet switch.
- It's important to label the patch panel correctly.

## Hubs

- Legacy connections
- 10BAse-T and 100Base-T
- Star topology
- A hub has a number of ports (4-48) to which different devices connect
- Collision domain => Each PC receives the traffic from all other computers and ignores the ones not addressed to their MAC address.
- Performance reduced when a lot of computers in same collision domain.
- Not compatible with Gigabit ehternet

## Switches

- Switch is like a hub but it routes messages to different PCs by their MAC address.
- It forwards each frame to the corresponding port efficiently
- Each switch port is in a separate collision domain
- When a computer sends a frame, swithc reads MAC address and adds it to it's table list.

### Installation
- Selecting a switch is not easy, as they have very specific use cases and are expensive.
- Where to put it
    - Small => Underneath desk
    - Larger => Server room
- Consider airflow when installing Switches and cable management => Switches airflow from left to right.
- Patch panel makes it easier to switch connections
- Colored cables to identify what device it is (voip phone, pc) or which department it belongs to.
- Fiber connectors to Switch => Trunks to provide redundancy of the network
- Power
    - Ideally each switch connected to a separate circuit and UPSs, to make it more resilient
    - Some plugs look like standard computer D plugs, but they have a little notch => higher gauge
    - If it's a layer-2 switch you can start using it when you plug it in
    - More advanced (CISCO) switches require more work => They run tests first and give you a prompt to configure
    - After that it gives port list
- Verify that it s funcitoning => Link lights start flickering (traffic)

### Unmanaged and managed switches
