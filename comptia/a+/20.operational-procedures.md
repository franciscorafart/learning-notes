# Operational Procedures

- Documentation, communication techniques, safety and environmental procedures

# Best Documentation Practices

- IT support dependes on ticketing system to keep track of issues and their state

## Standard Operation Procedure (SOP)

- Orgs need written policies and procedures so employees can fulfill their tasks

Best practices:
- Policy overall statement of intent
- SOP: Step-by-step list of actions that must be completed for any task to comply with policy
- Guidelines are for areas of policy where there's no procedure due to decision process too complex or situatuin not assessed.

Examples of SOP
- Procedures for custom installation of Software: System requirements, validating source, license validity, add software to Control process, training and documentation
- New user setup checklist
- End user termination checklist => Offboarding process, returning and sanitizing devices, disabling accounts, releasing software licenses.

## Ticketing Systems

- Manages requests, incidents, and problems
- Supports internal users and customers

General process:
1. User contacts help desk
    - unique job ID is generated
    - Capture basic user information
    - Record device's information (ideally)
2. User supplies description of the issue
3. Agent categorizes support case and gives it urgency and time estimation
4. Agent takes user through initial torubleshooting steps => Escalate if necessary

### Categories
- Categories relate tickets together => Useful for assigning tickets
Basic ticket types:
 - Requests
    - Provisioning things IT has SOP for/ Ex. Set user account
- Incidents
    - Errors encountered by end-users or customers
    - Further categorized by Severity, impact and urgency
- Problems:
    - Causes of incidents => require analysis
    - Generated internally

- Designing categories that are useful but not confusing is a challenge
    - One approach: Few simple top-level categories user can self-select
        - Then technician can assign more specific subcategory
        - Add standard keywords or tags

### Severity

- Priority of ticket
    - Critical => Wide customers and potential data breach
    - Major => Affect limited users and involve suspected security violation
    - Minor => No significant effects on customers

## Ticket Management

- System must track ownership of a ticket (who) and status (is it done?)
- Process might require escalation,when an agent cannot resolve the ticket

### Escalation reasons
- Incident related to problem and requires senior technician / third-party support
- Incident severity needs to be escalated (minor to major, major to critical)
- Incident needs involvement of sales and marketing to deal with complaints or refunds

Support team tier to deal with escalation levels
- Tier 0: Self-service => Knowledge base or help bot
- Tier 1: Connects customer to agent for initial diagnosis and possible incident resolution
- Tier 2: Agente escalates to senior techinician (Tier 2- internal) ot thrid-party (Tier 2 external)
- Tier 3: Escalation to a development engineer or senior managers

- Ownership can be reassigned on escalation => Owner must be always clearly identified

### Clear written communication

Three fields that reflect ticket life cycle
1. Problem description => Initial request and details
2. Progress notes => Discoveries made in identifying the probable cause and tools used
3. Problem resolution => Plan of action and documentation of fix and testing plan. Should record end-user acceptance for the ticket to be closed.

- Important to use clear and concise language:
    - Plain language instead of jargon
    - Concices, minimum of facts an actions required to describe proess or issue

### Incident reports
- For major or critical incidents => Also named After Action Report (AAR)
- Purpose is to identify underlying causes of issue and recommend steps to mitigate the repetition of issue

## Asset identification and Inventory

- Asset management keeps catalog of hardware and software
    - Implements life-cycle policies to provision, maintain and decomission all systems of IT services
    - Tangible assets: hardware deployed or stored
    - Intangible assets: Software licenses, data assets, Intellectual property (IP)

### Database systems

- Many software solutions for tracking and managing inventory
- Asset management database stores data on devices
- Inventory management suite can scan network and retreive hardware / software configuration and monitoring data (Ex. Lansweeper)

### Asset tags and IDs

- Each instance of asset type requires a unique ID => Hardware devices should be tagged with this ID as barcode or RFID sticker
- RFID stores asset data and updated management software of location when scanned.

### Network topology diagrams

- Shows how assets are linked as Nodes => Map physical and logical relationship of assets
- Physical network topology
    - Schematic diagram shows cabling layout of network
    - Can show logical structure of network: Security zones, VLANs, IP subnets
    - Can be drawn manually or using tool like Microsoft Visio that compiles automatically from network mapping software

## Asset Documentation

Procurement life cycle => Discrete stages in use of hardware and software:
- Change procedures => Approve request for upgraded asset
- Procurement => Budgets and indentifies trusted suppliers
- Deployment => Procedures for secure intallation of asset
- Disposal => Procedure for sanitizing and disposing (recycling, donation, selling, destroying)

### Warranty and Licensing
- Asset records should inclide invoice, warranty support, licensing, device/user allocation details

### Assigned users
- Devices assigned to individuals or security groups for department job roles.
- Shared-use assets can be allocated to individual technicians or security groups => Better practice than default administrator accounts.

### Support documentation and knowledge base articles
- Link inventory record to troubleshooting and support sources => product docs, setup guide, deployment checklist
- Knowledge Base (KB) => Repository of articles for FAQ for common troubleshooting scenarios
    - Each inventory item can be linked to a part of the intenal knowledge base  for self-service
- Asset notes field => To link external knowledge base resources

## Change Management Concepts

- Change management: Policies and procedures that reduce risk of configuration changes that lead to service downtime.

### ITIL Configuration Management Protocol (IT Infrastructure Library)

- Service assets are things, processes and people who deliver IT service
- Configuration Item (CI) => Asset that requires specific configuration to provide IT service
- Configuration baseline => Settings for CI that should ensure secure and reliable operation
- Performance baselines => Metrics for expected performance => Basic comparison for ongoing monitoring of CI

- Difficulty: Determine level o detail that must be preserved on how to manage MACs (Moves, adds, changes)

### Change Requests
Two types:
- Reactive: Change forced on organization
- Proactive: Change anticipated and initiated internally

- Request for Change (RFC) => Form used in formal change-management process. Needs to specify:
    - Purpose of change => Business case, benefits, risks
    - Scope of the change = Number of devices, users and custoers affected. Costs and timescale.

## Change Approval

### Change Board Approval
- Major changes => Change Advisory Board (CAB) => Assess business case, technical merits, risk of change pane
    - CAB should include stakeholders who will be impacted by change (who is affected, implements, proposes it)
- Minor or normal change => Supervisor or department manager

### Risk Analysis
- It should identify possitive enhancements and things that could go wrong
- Two approaches:
    - Quantitative risk => Discrete values of impact and likelihood of factor
    - Qualitative risk => identify and evaluate impact and likelihood factors from previous experience and informed opinion

It can be expressed as discrete value: Red, Yellow, Green
- If change plan with high risk approved stakeholders must now and prepare to react to them.

### Test and Implement the Change Plan

- Implementation must be carefully planed considering impact to affected systems
- Testing change first is important => Sandbox testing in computing environment that replicates production conditions
- Production change should be scheduled at appropiate time => Minimize impact risk
    - Enterprises have scheduled authorized downtime
- Change should have a rollback plan in case things don't go as planned

### End-user acceptance

- Change plan must include end user acceptace
- Process of adapting is hard and people might magnify minor problems
3 strategies for mitigating risk:
    - Change requests should be considered by stakeholders that represent user or customer
    - It should incorporate UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
    - Training and education resources must be available before change initiated

## Policy Documentation

- AUP (Acceptable Use Policy) => Sets what a user can do or not with a system
    - Ex. Business specifies how employees can use equipment, ISP enforcing fair use policy
- Enforcing AUP important for security and legal implications
- Implementing regulatory compliance as logical controls could be necessary Ex. Splash screen on login to explain users what they can/can't do

# Proper Communication techniques

- Set proper expectations
- Speak in plain English instead of jargon
- Mind cultural and context differences 
- Educate user

## Professional support processes

- Ensure customer their inquiry will be handled efficiently

### Proper documentation
- Documentation should explain hours of operation to set expectations of response time

### Set expectations and timeline
- Acknowledgge request and set expectations => Repeat request back and set timeline. Clarify:
    - What will be done and when
    - Address customers concerns about cost or impact
    - Contraints: time, parts, cost, obligations

### Meet expectations and timelines
- Drive the problem to acceptance and resolution => Solve it or escalate.
- Tickets should be re-prioritized accordingly
- Managing customers expectations is very important => They shouldn't be calling you to find out what is happening

### Repair and replace options

- Repair: Clear instructions on how to package and return item for repair with ticket-tracking number and reutned-merchandise authorization (RMA)
- Replace: Give customer clear instructionon when replacement product will be delivered

### Follow up
Once problem is solved:
- Explain to the customer what happened and check later that problem didn't happen again
- Log the ticket as closed when customer expresses satisfaction with resolution of problem
- Record solution and send verification to customer via phone or email

## Professional Support Delivery

- Be on time
- Avoid distractions => Specially at customer's site
- Deal appropiately with confidential and private materials
    - Do not open files or apps, or any confidential and private information
    - Don't look at printed confidential information
    - Don't use equipment for any other purpose than resolving the ticket
    - On site visit, keep work area clean and tidy => Leave it as you found it

## Professional Appereance

### Professional appereance and attire
- Represent professionalism on site. Wear company uniform or suitable clothes/
    - Formal attire => Sober colors, minimal accesories or jewlery
    - Business casual. Smart clothes, not shorts, skirts tshirts,jeans.
### Proper language
- Make eye contact, greet customer, introduce self and company
- Make sure your customer understands what you're saying => Clear and concise statements, avoid jargon.
- Avoid being too famiiar or using slang.

### Cultural sensitivity

- As a general rule, start communicating formally and become more familiar gradually if customer comfortable with it
- Behavior not determined by culture => Don't make assumptions, treat people as individuals
- If accent a barrier, use visual aids or demonstrations
- Personal space is cultural, be aware of how close you are to others.

## Professional communications

### Active listening
- Focused listening trying to understand what other person is saying
- Restate issue and summarize what has just being said good technique
- Take notes

### Clarifying and questioning techniques
Two types of questions:
- Open-ended: Invite customer to compose reponse.
- Closed: Yes or No or some other fixed response.

- Start with open-ended questions and get more specific gradually
- If customer not getting to the point, restart with closed questions
- Long sequence of closed questions can overwhelm customer.

## Difficult Situations
- When customer or technician becomes angry or upset

### Maintain a positive attitude
- Understand custoer is angry because things are not working properly
- Empathize with customer to develop relationship. Saying sorry doesn't mean you agree with customer
Avoid following situations:
1. Arguing with customer
2. Denying problem exists o dismiss importance
3. Being judgmental

### Collaborate to Focus on Solutions
1. Identify early sign that customer is becoming angry
2. Do not take compainns personally
3. Calmly listen to the customer explain the problem
4. HAng up => If customer becomes abusive or threatening.

### Don't post experiences on Social Meida
- It can cause unpredictable reactions
- It is hard to withdraw

# Common Safety and Environmental Procedures

## Compliance with regulations

- Health and safety laws
- Building codes
- Environmental regulations

- In the OSHA standards for employee safety regulations
- In general, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthy work environment
- Employers shouldn't interfere with safety systems
- Emplyees shouldn't install devices, equipment or materials without authorization and assessment of installation

## Electrical Safety
Properties electric circuit:
- Current (A) is amount of cahrge flowing through cinductor
- Voltage is potenrial difference between to point (pressure in water pipe)
- Resistance: Degree of oposition of conductor (Ohms)

### Fuses
- Safety device that blows if maximum current exceeded

### Equipment grounding
- Electrical equipment must be grounded
- If exposed metal parts, ground provides path of least resistance for electric current to flow away
- PCs and printers connected to ground via power plug
- Do not remove ground wire, must be replaced by professional electrician

### Proper Power Handling and Personal Safety

- Always disconnect power when changing a component on a PC or laptop
- Remova AC plug and battery if present
- Hold power button to drain residual power on devices.
- PCs have dangerous voltages 
    - Never insert anythng to power supply fan to get it to rotate

### Electrical Fire Safety
- Faulty equipment is fire hazard
- Best fire extinguishers use CO2 (Black label) => Safer to use near electrical equipment instead of foam and water
- Dry powder as well, though it can damage electronic equipment
- Ensure electric supply is turned off => Know where power master switches are in a building.

## Other Safety Hazard Mitigations

### Trip Hazards
    - Don't leave wires or cables unsecured, or across walways
    - Do not leave PCs or other devices on walkways when servicing them

### Lifting techniques
- Bend knees when lifting heavy equipment
- Do not jerk object up
- If you can't lift, help from coworker or cart
    - Secure the equipment to card
    - Don't stack loose items

### Safety Googles and Masks
- Gloves and safety goggles to minimize burns from corrosive materials
- Air filter mask when working with toner, dust, or air canister => Asthma or bronquitis should avoud changing toner catridges

## Environmental impacts
- Equipment should be stored away from extreme tempratures, damp or dusty conditions.

### Dust cleanup
- Dust accumuations prevents efficient heat dissipation
- Use compressed air blaster to clean (Not for Toner spills)
- Use PC vacuum cleaner or natural bristle brush
    - Can be used for Toner only if labeled as toner-safe

### Temprature, Humidity, VEntilation control
- Ensure room temprature is not to high for ventilation => Don't place on direct sunlight or near radiator
- Humidity causes condensation => Damage to components. 
    Low humidity aLlows static charges to build up => Ideal 50% humidity
- Allow new equiment to adjust to new temperature in original packaging, to avoid condensation due to temperature change.

## Electrostatic Discharge mitigation (ESD)
- ESD occurs when a static charged body releases charge onto discharged body => touch or small gap
- It can damahe delicate electronic devices => Damage can show much later
- Clothes allow for static to build up, specially when walking over carpet
- Low humidity increases chance of static build-up

### Proper component handling
- Work in uncarpeted area, use ESD-safe floor or chair mat
- Touch unpainted metal chasis or power supply to drain residual charge => Temporary, charge can build up again
- Wear anti-ESD wrist strap to disipate charge ore effectiveli
- Use anti-ESD service mat to place and organize sensitive components
- Hold vulnerable components by the edges

### Proper component storage
- Component sstored and shipped in antistatic packaging
- Antistatic bags
    - Coated with conductive material
    - Have semi-reflective gloss
Dissipative packaging:
    - ligh pink or blue packaging => slightly moreconductive than normal
    - Plastic bag or foam can be sprayed with antistatic coating
    - Used to package non-static sensitive components close to static-sensitive components.

## Building Power Issues and Mitigations

Problems in building power supplies:
- Surge/Spike: Brief increase in voltage/ Intense surge => Can crash, reboot or damage PC
- Under-voltage event => Can cause PC to power off
- Power failure

Power protection devices:

- Surge Supressors: Adapters, trailing sockets, filter plugs with protection circuits built-in. Low cost protection.    

    - Rated by standards like Underwriters Laboratory (UL) 1449. 
    - 3 Characteristics:
        1. Clapmping voltage (Activation threshold). Lower is better.
        2. Joules rating => Amount of energy protector can absorb. 600+ juules better. Surge events degrade the capabilities of supressors
        3. Amperage
            - Maximum current that can be carried
            - Rule of thumb: use max 80% of capacity

- Battery Backups
    - Protect on the event of power loss
    - System operation can be sustained for a few minutes with battery backup
    - Can be provisioned at component level (Disk, RAID, memory)
    - Protect read/write operations cached at time of power loss

- UPS - Uninterruptable Power Supply
    - Temporary power source in event of complete power loss.
    - Gives sufficient tme to activate alternative power source like a generator
    - If no generator, it will allow you to save files and shutdown
    - Characteristics:
        VA rating: 
            - Maximum load UPS can sustain.
            - Minimum VA: Wattage of all devices * 1.67 (account for conversion factor)
        Runtime: Number of minutes the battery will supply power. Measured in Amp per hour (Ah)

## Materials Handling and Responsible Disposal

- PCs and printers have hazardous components for health and environment
- Comply with reulations

### Material Safety Data Sheets

- Emplyers must assess and take stemps to eliminate or control risk
- Work with hazardous substances should not take place if assessment hasn't been made
- Emplyees have the right to refuse to work with hazardous substances if it hasn't been assesses

### Material Safety Datasheet (MSDS)
- Supplier of checmical must provide detailed information with handling, disposal and recycling information
- Refer to it when handing components such as monitors, power supplies, batteries, toner, cleaning products.

### Proper disposal

- Computer equipment classifies as Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)
Special care must be taken for:
    - Battery disposal
        - Use gloves and safety goggles to handle
        - Store in appropiate containers
        - Dispose through approved waste management or recycling facility
    - Toner Disposal
        - Extremely fine poweder can create respiratory problems
        - Vendors provide recycling schemes
        - Loose toner must be removed with approved toner vacuum and stored within strong plastic container.
    - Other devices:
        - PC and mobile devices contain toxins, heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic)
        - Don't dispose as genera waste in landfill or incinerators
        - Dispose through aproved waste managent and recycling facility
