# Operational Procedures

- Documentation, communication techniques, safety and environmental procedures

# Best Documentation Practices

- IT support dependes on ticketing system to keep track of issues and their state

## Standard Operation Procedure (SOP)

- Orgs need written policies and procedures so employees can fulfill their tasks

Best practices:
- Policy overall statement of intent
- SOP: Step-by-step list of actions that must be completed for any task to comply with policy
- Guidelines are for areas of policy where there's no procedure due to decision process too complex or situatuin not assessed.

Examples of SOP
- Procedures for custom installation of Software: System requirements, validating source, license validity, add software to Control process, training and documentation
- New user setup checklist
- End user termination checklist => Offboarding process, returning and sanitizing devices, disabling accounts, releasing software licenses.

## Ticketing Systems

- Manages requests, incidents, and problems
- Supports internal users and customers

General process:
1. User contacts help desk
    - unique job ID is generated
    - Capture basic user information
    - Record device's information (ideally)
2. User supplies description of the issue
3. Agent categorizes support case and gives it urgency and time estimation
4. Agent takes user through initial torubleshooting steps => Escalate if necessary

### Categories
- Categoires relate tickets together => Useful for assigning tickets
Basic ticket types:
 - Requests
    - Provisioning things IT has SOP for/ Ex. Set user account
- Incidents
    - Errors encountered by end-users or customers
    - Further categorized by Severity, impact and urgency
- Problems:
    - Causes of incidents => require analysis
    - Generated internally

- Designing categories that are useful but not confusing is a challenge
    - One approach: Few simple top-level categories user can self-select
        - Then technician can assign more specific subcategory
        - Add standard keywords or tags

### Severity

- Priority of ticket
    - Critical =>Wide customers and potential data breach
    - Major => Affet limited users and involve suspected security violation
    - Minor => No significant effects on customers
