# Scripting Tools

# Remote Access Technologies

- Desktop and command line tools to control computer remotely

## Remote Desktop tools

- Graphical terminal server that accepts connections from clients
- Often used for working from home or for technician troubleshooting
Considerations:
- Remote access with least privilege principle
- Encrypted connection to avoid spoofing and digital certificate to avoid evil-twin attacks.
- Server software must be free from vulnerabilities

### Remote Desktop Protocol (mstsc.exe)
- Windows remote desktop control
- Use IP or server's FQDN to connect
- Use domain or local account as credentials for remote host `Domain\Username` or `\ Username` or `Host\Username`
- Connection always encrypted
- One person signed in at a time
- Client software for Linux, Mac, and Windows

### Virtual Network Computing (VNC)
- Screen share is an alternative for Mac => Based on Virtual Network Computing  
- VNC: Remote access tool and protocol
    - Similar functionality as RDP
    - Encrypted in MacOS (Not on all versions of VNC)
    - TCP 5900
    - Dumb: Send actual pictures of screen.
    - Available in different platforms
    - Less performant

## RDP Servers and Security settings

- Remote Server Desktop must be enabled (disabled by default) `Settings > Remote Desktop`
- Users allowed to Remote desktop from local accounts db or from machine domain.
- Advanced Settings => Define if older accounts allowed to connect or require clients to support Network Level Authentication (NLA)
    - NLA protects against DoS attacks, configuring desktop and allocating resources AFTER user authenticates.
- Compromised Client device makes the credentials highly vulnerable
    - RDP Restricted Admin (RDPRA) Mode and Remote Credential Guard are means of mitigating this risk
- Runs of port 3389 by default
- Not included on Windows Home Editions
- XRDP is open source solution => To run RDP on Linux for example

## Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA - msra.exe)
- Allows to ask help to technician or coworker via invitation file protected by passcode
- Open file to connect over RDP
- Chat feature and control of desktop request
- Assigns port dinamically -> Hard to configure Firewall to allow connection
- Windows 10 introduces Quick Assit as alternative to MSRA => Works over https and helper must be signed with Microsoft account

## Secure Shell (SSH)
- CLI remote access protocol
- Port 22
- Encrypted
- Open source ssh products
- SSH server configured with public/private key pair, identified by host key fingerprint
- Client uses host fingerprint to verify they're connecting to trusted server
- Mapping of host names and SSH server keys kept manaully or software product for SSH key management
- Server's key pair sets encrypted channel by which Client can provide authentication credentials
2 Methods of authentications:
1. Password: Client provides user name and password
2. Public key authentication: 
    - Server has list of public keys of authorized user accounts.
    - Client requests auth with one of those keys and Server generates challenge with it => Client must use private key to decrypt the challenge and complete authentication.

## Desktop Management and Remote Monitoring Tools

Remote managment and monitor tools necessary for efficient administration of network devices => Technician can't phisically visit all devices.

2 classes of enterprise monitoring/remote access tools:

1. RMM (Remote monitoring and Management)
    - Designed for managed service providers (MSPs)
    - MSP is outsourcing company for IT support

2. UEM (Desktop management unified endpoint management)
    - Access control and authorization for a single organization

They offer mix of follwing functionalities:

1. Locally installed agents to report status, log, inventory, and ticket/help desk integration
2. Agents taht perform EDR Endpoint Detection and Response Security scans => Early threat detection
3. Automated "push: of patches, upgrades, apps, scripts, etc
4. Remote network boot capabilities or Wake on LAN (WOL) and remote system firmware update
5. Access control for hosts that don't meet OS versions
6. Live chat and Remote Desktop / Shell connections to Host

- Software agent depends on OS to be running
- Management suite can take advantage of hardware controller => Out-of-Band update or Power machine remotely.

## Other Remote Access Tools

- There are cheaper alternatives for Sofware and Protocols when managing a limited amount of PCs

### Screen sharing software
- Alternatives to Screen Sharing tlike MSRA/Quick assist
- Ex. Team Viewer, LogMein => Work over https
- Can be installed locally or be executed non-persistenly

### Video Conferencing Software
- Video conferencing tools include screen-share client (Zoom, Teams, Slack)
- Share willhave privilege of signed in user
- Useful for demoing tasks and reproducing support issues

### File Transfer Software
- OS Vendors have different solution for file sharing to avoid setting up file sharing servers
1. Airdrop.
    - iOS
    - WiFi and Bluetooth
    - Encrypted
2. Nearby Sharing
    - Microsoft's version of AirDrop
    - Introduced in Windows 10
3. Nearby share
    - Bluetooth sharing for Android devices

- This products are generally secure but can be misused => Accepting connections from any source a danger

### Virtual Private Networks
- SSH and RDP => Connection to single host over a network
- VPN => tunneled link between local PC and remote LAN
- Both can be combined for extra security => VPN and Remote Desktop to avoid opening reote desktop ports on Firewall (Important)

# Backup and Recovery

- Backup to mitigate effects of disaster or malware
- Backup dificult to implement because it's a routine procedure that needs to cope with uncommon scenarios => Difficult to plan
- Backups can also fail

Backup strategies
Why are we backing up? Restore system, versioning?
What do we need to backup? File, app?

- RTO: Recovery Time Objective
- RPO: Recovery Point Objective

- 321 Rule of backup
    - Primary and 2 copies.
    - One backup off site

## Backup Operations
- Storing of critical data for safekeeping
- Data Recovery: Task that enables to restore user access to lost or currupt data via backup

- Most orgs implement structured backup scheme that included backup schedule and specify which files to backup
- Bad practice to store data locally if connected to a Network => Move it to a server where it can be backed up safely
- Personal backups necessary when no central file server available
- Windows user backup in `File History` through `Settings > Update & Security > Backup` 
    - Configure Local drive or network flder as target for storage.
    - Select which files to backup or not
    - Previos Version tab or File history applet to restore multiple files
- Backup ad Restore Center (Windows)
    - Alternative backup manager
    - It can make images of whole OS instead of just data files

- Mac: Time Machine

## Backup Methods
- Policies for backup frequency and methods should be established in policies
- Adequate coverage while minimizing backup storage
2 main factors
1. Frequency
    - Period between backup jobs
    - Determined by how much loss can be tolerated
2. Retention
    - Period a backup is kept for
    - Short term -> Version control and malware recovery
    - Regulations might require data not be kept for more than a certain time

### Backup chains
- Different backub jobs in a Backup Chain: Sequence of jobs(Full backup - Incremental - differential) to implement media rotation scheme
    1. Full only
        - Backup job produces a file that contains all data from source
        - Highers storage and time requirements, least recovery complexity
        - Single job (Full backup)
    2. Full with incremental
        - Chain starts with full backup and then runs incremental jobs to select new and modified files
        - Lowest time and storage requirement, most recovery complexity
        - Multiple jobs
    3. Full with differential
        - Chain starts with full backup
        - Runs differential jobs that select new and modified files since original full job
        - Moderate time and storage requirements, slighly less recovery complexity than incremental
        - Max of 2 jobs (Full and differential)

- Windows uses archive attribute to determine backup status, Linux doesn't support it, but uses a timestamp that determines when a file was changed

### Synthetic full backup
- Option for full backup with lower datatransfer requirements
- Not generated directly from original data, bit assembled from previous backup jobs

1. Chain starts with initial full backup, and does incremental ones after
2. Next full backup => software makes one more incremental backup and synthesizes a new full backup from previous full and incremental backups

## Backup Media Requirements
- Backup rotation scheme => Allows some media to be reused once retention period over
Rotation schemes:
1. GFS - Grandfather-Father-Son
    - Labels backup tapes by generations
        - Sons: Most recent data, shortest retention period (week, days)
        - Grandfather: Oldest data longest retention period (months, year(s))
    Implementation example:
        1. Full backup each week to Father tape (weekly)
        2. Incremental backups made on Son tape (each day or every x amount of minutes)
        3. Full backup performed at the end if the month on Grandfather tape
        4. Father tapes reused for next month on same order
    - Father tapes can use synthetic backuos

### On Site vs. Off Site Storage
On site: Production and backup on same physical location => Risk in case of disaster
- Media rotation scheme such as GFS => some backup media is taken off site, and some others kept off site (Grandfather) until backup routine happens
- Cloud backup also has risks

### Online vs Offline backups

- Online backup
    - Instantly available to perform backup or restore operation
- Offline 
    - Backup must be physically connected to perform recovery
    - Better security (Be able to recover from crypto ransomware for example)

### 3-2-1 Backup rule
- 3 copies of data, including production copy
- Two media types
- One copy on site, one copy off site

## Backup testing and Recovery Best Practices

- Test backup scheme to make sure it's reliable => Test recovery into virtual machine or into test directory
- Configure backup software to verify after it writes => Hashing to verify job is valid copy of source data
    - Verify media integrity regulary by running `chkdsk`
- Verify backups contain all required files
- ReTest recovery procedures every time there's a change to backup schedule or requirements => Do it periodically

# Data Handling Best Practices

## Regulated Data classification

- Regulated data: Must be stored, collected, and processed in compliance with federal / state legislation.
- Data exfiltration: malicious breach of data

### Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Data that can be used to identify, locate, or impersonate person (Ex. Name, SSN, phone, answer to security questions) => Possible identity theft
- Some data is PII depending on the context. Ex. IP address can identify a person

### Personal Government-issued information
Ex. Passport, SSN, drivers license, certificates.

### Healthcare data
- Ex. Insurance records, hospital and lab tests.
- Anonymized data set: Identifying data is removed completely
- Very sensitive information

### Credit Card Transactions
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) governs credit card transactions and any payments.
    - Specific cyber security measures 
- Industry or International frameworks establish "Best Practices"
    - Ex. NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology)

### Data handling best practices
- Employees have to be able to recognize PPI and treat it accordingly => No unauthorized copies or sharing
    - Ex. Not leaving credit card transactions on a desk, storing credit card info in unencrypted notes, or forwarding email with personal data.

### Data retention requirements
- Regulation might set minimum or maximum amount of data retention

## Prohibited Content and Licensing Issues

 - Consider methods for identifying and removing prohibited data from workstations

### Prohibited Content
- Information not applicable to work
- Obscene content or illegally pirated

### End-user License Agreements (EULA)
- Unauthorized installation of software
- Usually software can be installed on only one PC and used by one person
- EULA could distinguish persona and business use => If a user installs a sotware for personal use on a business machine then there's license infringement

### License Compliance Monitoring

- Product activated with key => Generates unique product ID that can be used for support
- Personal license => Use of one person at a time
- Corporate use license when software needs to be used by multiple people
- Pirated software is illegal and often contains viruses and errors.

Monitor for:
- Valid licenses
    - Do not use personal licenses on business equipment
    - Match number of licenses purchased with number of devices => Software management solutions to avoid exceeding number

- Expired Licenses
    - Software must be uninstalled if license expires => track renewal dates

### Open-source licenses

- Free use software
- Doesn't forbid commercial use but usually establishes conditions (redistribution policies)
- Commercial open source software might be governed by additional subscription and enterprise agreements

### Digital Rights Management

- Music and Video subject to Digital Rights Management (DRM) => Usually limit number of devices allowed for playback
- From enterprise point of view, content with DRM removed by hackers is prohibited content => Monitor systems to ensure machines are not hosting pirated content.

## Incident Response

Possible incident scenarios:
- Network infected with virus, Trojan, worm
- Data breach or exfiltration
- Phishing attempt or Evil Twin on AP
- DDos Attack
- Users with unlincensed software in PCs
- Finding prohibited content on PC

### Incident Response Plan (IRP)
- Sets guidelines to deal with security incidents
- Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) on large organizations
    - Manager and technicians who can deal with incidents on own initiative
    - Senior decision makers to authorize actions following serious incidents
- Immediate actions can have critical incidence on subsequent investigation
- If no formal CSIRT enforce local law enforcement

## Data integrity and preservation

- Digital Forensics: Science of collecting evidence to standards that hold up in court of law
    - It's latent => must be interpreted using a machine process
- Digital forensics usually handled by law enforcement agencies
- Technicians and Managers should be aware of the processes investigators will use (in case of a possible investigation)
    - Defense will exploit any uncertainty or mistake regarding integrity of evidence

### Documentation of Incident Recovery of Evidence

Procedure to ensure data integrity/preservation in a security incident:
1. Identify scope of the incident and insulate affected systems from network
2. Document scene with photos, audio, and video => Record every action investigators take to identify, collect and handle evidence.
3. Gather evidence from systems still powered on
    - Live foresnic tools to capture cache, file systems and system memory content
    - Use video to record screen if forensic tools not available
4. Disable encrytpion and screen lock and power off device
5. Use forensic tool to make disk copies => Forensic tool uses Write blocker to ensure no changes are made while imaging the disk
6. Make cryptographic hash of every source disk and forensic image => To prove forensic evidence has not been modified later than collection
7. Collect physical devices using tamper-evident bags and chain-of-custody form to transport and secure storage

### Chain of Custody
- Access to evidence must be strictly controlled, as digital evidence can be tampered
- `Chain of custody` form records where, when and who collected evidence, handled it, and stored it.
    - Must show storage and transportation
    - Everyone who handles evidence must sign chain of custody and explain what they were doing with it

## Data Destruction Methods

- Repurposed or recycled devices must be properly sanitized before media released, inside or outside an organization.
- Sanitation methods => Understand first if media is recoverable from media and likelihood of attempt
    - Data marked as "Deleted" is not erased from disk => Block is marked as available for writting, only removed when data overwritten
    - Standard Formatting => Only removes references fo files and marks all sectors as useable.
    - With proper tools, all information of a HDD is recoverable. SSDs require special tools, but still possible.

### Erasing wiping
- Erasing/wiping software ensures old data destroyed by writting to each location on HHD (zeros or random pattern)
    - Suitable for all but the most confidential data
    - Requires special software
    - Doesn't work reliably with SSDs

### Low-evel Format
- Most vendors supply low-level format tools to reset to factory conditions

1. Secure Erase (SE)
    - Zero fillings on HHDs and marks all blocks as empty on SSDs
    - SSDs firmware garbage collector performs erase of blocks over time
    - If process not completed, remnant recovery possible.
2. Instant Secure Erase (ISE)
    - Crypto Erase uses capabilities of self-encrypting drives (SEDs) as reliable sanitization method for HHDs and SSDs
    - SED uses media encryption key (MEK)
    - Crypto Erase erases the MEK, makind encrypted data unrecoverable.

Alternative: Use Software disk-encryption utility and then destroy the key and run SE

## Disposal and Recycling Outsourcing Concepts

- Physical destruction could be appropiate destruction method
    Shredding
    - Incinerating: Melt components.Iser furnace designed for media sanitization, Municipal incinerators can leave remnants
    - Degaussing: Powerful electromagnet => Doesn't work on SSDs or optical media
    - Drill and hammer => Not appropaite for most confidential data as it can leave fragments

- Vendors specializing on secure disposal should provide `certificate of destruction` with info about destruction process

# Basic of Scripting

- Scripts usefull to perform repetitive tasks
- ex. Adding user, reseting processes, install printer

## Shell Scripting

Three categories programming languages:

1. Shell scripting => OS commands
2. Scripting language
    - Statements and modules independent of OS
    - Executed by interpreter
    - Interpreter implements the language for a particular OS
3. Programming language => Compiles executable files that can be installd to an OS and executed as apps

- Text Editor
- IDE
    - For more complex projects
    - Provides autocomplete
    - Helps identify correct execution of script / program

### Linux shell .sh
- Starts with shebang line `#!/bin/bash` that designates the interpreter to use bash binary
- In Linux script needs execution permission to run

## Basic Script constructs

- Comments
- Variables
    - declared and given initial value (usually)
    - Usually have data type
    - argument or paramter -> value passed to script when executed. Bash `$1` `$2` arguments by position
    - Other languages have named arguments
### Branches and loops
    - Script executes from top to bottom
    - You can change order of execution with branches and loops:
    - Branches
         - Instruction that is executing depending on a logic test `if` statement

    - Loops
        - Allows repetition of statement block
        - For loops
        - While / Until

### Operators
- Operators allow to set up logical tests (True or False)

## Windows Scripts

Windows supports PowerShell, Visual Basic Script, and CMD interpreter

### Powershell (PS)
- Script language with prebuilt modules called `cmdlets`
- Can access and change most of components and feature in Windows Active Directory
- They use verb-noun naimng convention Ex. `Write-Host` / `Read-Host`
- .PS1 file extension
- Windows provides Integrated Scripting Environment ISE for Powershell

### VBScript
- Scripting language based on Visual Basic
- .VBS file extension, predates PowerShell
- Executed by `wscript.exe`
- Might be useful for legacy script support

### Batch fies
- Used on the CMD interpreter
- .BAT extension

## Javasrcript and Python

- Independent of platform (Windows)

### JS
- Web browsers configured with JS interpreter
- .js extension
- Windows Script host `wscript.ext` and `cscript.exe` support JS
- Supported on MacOC for automation => JXA Javascript For Automation

### Py
- Automation scripts and software apps
- Ran with interpreter or as binary executable
- Interpreters CPython, PyPy
- .py extension
- `pythonw.exe` interpreter in Windows => `.pyw` extension associated with it
- Two major verions: 2 and 3
    - `python` executes 2 => End of Life
    - `python3` executes 3 

## Scripting Use cases

- Scripts primarilly used for automation
- If using scripting language, script must use OSs API to call functions
    - Python has many modules implemented for automating Windows, Linux, and macOS
        `os` module => File system, user, process manipulation
        `mod_python` => Python interpreter for Apache web server
### Restaring machines

- Windows: `Restart-Computer`
- Linux: `shutdown -r` => Rarely needed

### Remapping network drives
- `net use` to perform drive mapping (Windows batch file)
- `New-PSDrive` cmdlet in PowerShell
- `mount` or `unmount` => Linux commands to mounting file system, Network Drive mapping is Windows concept
- Error handling is important part of developing scripts

### Installation of Applications

Windows
Using .exe file `C:\David\Downloads\setup.exe /S /desktopicon=yes`
Using windows installer: `msiexec c:\Downloads\install.msi /qn`

Linux
- Scripts used to copile apps from source code
- Script to automate installation from `apt` or `yum`

### Initiating updates
- `wusa.exe` from batch file to perform update tasks
- In Powershell `PSWindowsUpdate`
- Linux: `apt-get update` `apt update` ` yum update`

### Automated backups
- `robocopy` windows
- `cron` in Linux

### Gathering of information

- Hundreds of `Get-Verb` cmdlets in Windows to get info
- Linux: `ps` filters output by username
     `df` `grep` or format with `awk` or `cut`
    - `printf` appends header with date, time, and username

## Scripting best practies and considerations

- Code always implies risk of introducing vunerabilities

### Malware risks
- Threat actors can use PowerShell to craft fileless malware
- Modification of source code to make script act as malware (using scipt as Trojan)
- Script could open network port or expose user's form for input that can be exploited

Mitigate:
- Scripts should have access control and version controls => prevent unauthorized access
- Code should be scanned and tested
- Scripts should run with minimum privileges required for task

### Inadvertent System-Setting Changes
- Non-malicious scripts can perform unexpected system changes
    - Change firewall configuration
    - Weakening security
    - Disabling scanning software
    - Scripts that need to be run by disabling security mechanisms are not safe.
    - Test all code in development environment
    - Ensure changes to host required to run scripts are included in new baselines

### Browser or System crashed due to mishandling resources

- Mishandling of resources by scripts can lead to DoS attacks
- Scripting languages are memory-safe but they can still mishandle compute and storage resources.
    - Creating files that deplete system storage
    - Faulty loops that leave system hanging
    - Faulty API calls that causes crash
- Scripts should be tested to avoid problems before getting deployed
