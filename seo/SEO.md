# SEO TODO List
As a web developer, here's a to-do list of things you should do to ensure the websites you make for clients have good SEO:

1. Ensure the website has a clean and well-structured code: This means using proper HTML tags and formatting, avoiding excessive JavaScript and CSS, and optimizing images and other media to ensure fast page loading speeds.

2. Make the website mobile-friendly: Ensure the website is responsive and has a mobile-friendly layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. Google uses mobile-first indexing, which means they prioritize the mobile version of your website over the desktop version.

3. Optimize website URLs: Ensure that URLs are descriptive and user-friendly, containing relevant keywords for the page's content. Use hyphens to separate words and keep URLs short and sweet.

4. Use header tags appropriately: Use H1 tags for the main heading of each page, and H2-H6 tags for subheadings. This helps search engines understand the hierarchy of content on the page and improves user experience.

5. Optimize page titles and meta descriptions: Ensure each page has a unique and descriptive title tag and meta description that accurately reflects the content on the page. Use relevant keywords to improve click-through rates and search engine rankings.

6. Use alt tags for images: Ensure all images have descriptive alt tags that accurately describe the image and contain relevant keywords. This helps search engines understand the content of the image and improves accessibility for visually impaired users.

7. Use internal linking: Link relevant pages together using descriptive anchor text. This helps search engines understand the structure of the website and improves user navigation.

8. Ensure website speed is optimal: Use tools such as Google PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix any issues that may be slowing down the website. Site speed is a critical ranking factor for search engines and can impact user experience.

9. Set up and verify website with Google Search Console: This tool allows you to monitor website performance and receive alerts for any issues that may arise. It also provides valuable insights into how your website is performing in search engine results pages.

10. Ensure website has a sitemap: A sitemap is an XML file that lists all the pages on your website. Submitting a sitemap to Google Search Console helps search engines crawl and index your website more efficiently.
